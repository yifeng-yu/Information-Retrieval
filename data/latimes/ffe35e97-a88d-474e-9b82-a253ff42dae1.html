I could see them lift the trophy, but this is really fantastic,” Aleksandar Todorovic said. “We were great!” Waving flags and singing songs, the fans kept up their spirits as the crowd partly dispersed from Zagreb's main square. Firecrackers went off as the state TV proclaimed that “we are still not aware of what we have done.” Many fans went on celebrating into the evening. Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said the national team is “the first in the world for me.” “People are happy as if we have won, and that's the way it should be,” Plenkovic added. “This is a miraculous success for Croatia, and we should be very, very happy.” The fans were particularly proud that the team captain, Luka Modric, won the Golden Ball after being voted the best player of the World Cup. “We have achieved so much,” the 26-year-old Sofia Halinovcic said. “This is the best ever we did.” Halinovcic contended that “we had great expectations, but we still need to process what we have done.” Croatia is planning a huge welcome ceremony for its players on Monday that will include celebrations at the main square in Zagreb and a reception with the country's president.  ","dateModified":"2018-07-15T21:16:00.238Z","datePublished":"2018-07-15T21:08:00.000Z","headline":"Croatian fans proud of team despite disappointment of World Cup final loss","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aa0d0f4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x576+0+96/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F36%2Fcc%2F6709ad2e92dac54239feb50734b3%2Fla-lb-media-afp-getty-fbl-wc-2018-cro-fra-fans-20180715-135916","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#croatian-fans-proud-of-team-despite-disappointment-of-world-cup-final-loss"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageHow else should one of the most wild, unpredictable and entertaining World Cups in recent memory end, but with one of the wildest, most unpredictable and entertaining finals in recent memory.France and Croatia followed that script perfectly in a game that included an own goal, a penalty-kick goal, video replay and a goalkeeper gaffe that led directly to the final score.

He has let better financial opportunities pass in order to be national team coach. “This coach fulfills all the parameters to take charge of the team. Enrique is bringing his backroom staff, but this is a matter he will speak about next week.” Enrique, as both player and coach, didn't fit the typical model of the cerebral tactician steeped in the ways of Barcelona. But his fiery spirit proved to be just as successful— while it lasted. He started out as a player for his local Sporting Gijon team on Spain's Atlantic coast. He then won one league title while playing for Real Madrid before moving to fierce rival Barcelona in 1996, where he went on to win two more Liga crowns and became the captain before retiring in 2004. Overall, Enrique's achievements compare well to Pep Guardiola's. Barcelona won nine of a possible 13 titles in his three years in charge, compared to 14 of a possible 19 trophies in four seasons under Guardiola. At his presentation as Barcelona's coach, Enrique said his strength was motivating players. “I don't rely too heavily on tactical know-how, instead I focus on managing a group, managing egos,” he said. “There is work that goes on during the week, work based on knowing each player. I try to be everything a leader is.” Enrique achieved his greatest success at the beginning of his stint at Barcelona. The improvement was immediate. With Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez scoring lots of goals, Barcelona repeated the rare treble of Champions League-Spanish league-Copa del Rey titles first won under Guardiola. ","dateModified":"2018-07-09T15:49:14.342Z","datePublished":"2018-07-09T15:32:00.000Z","headline":"Spain already has a new coach after disappointing World Cup","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/db52e55/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x576+0+53/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fe2%2F29e8155711078bfda12b90bbcd7f%2Fla-lb-media-epa-rex-luis-enrique-announced-new-head-9746661a-20180709-073055","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#spain-already-has-a-new-coach-after-disappointing-world-cup"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe first time Antoine Griezmann met Thierry Henry he was 7.

El Tri hasn’t made it past the Round of 16 since 1986 and has never won a World Cup elimination game outside Mexico.For Brazil, the win extends its streak of reaching the quarterfinals to seven straight World Cups. Upsets in this tournament have already claimed the last two World Cup finalists and the last two World Cup winners.Mexico took down one of those giants, stunning reigning champion Germany in its opener. But it couldn’t get past Brazil, a team it has never beaten — and never scored upon — in World Cup competition.Brazil’s quarterfinal opponent will be determined in Monday’s late match between Belgium and Japan.The game in Samara, Russia, kicked off in sweltering 92-degree temperatures, making it as much a struggle for survival as it was a soccer match. Both teams slogged through a scoreless first half in which Mexico did not put a shot on goal and Brazil tested Mexican keeper Guillermo Ochoa three times.It was the first knockout game in this tournament not to have a goal in the first half but the 20th overall to be scoreless at the half. Only one of those previous games ended 0-0 and this one wouldn’t either after Neymar scored the game’s first goal in the 51st minute.The Brazilian talisman started the sequence by walking the ball across the top of the 18-yard box before sliding to Willian with a back-heel pass. The Chelsea midfielder then brought the ball into the area on the left side and sent a low left-footed cross past Mexican defender Miguel Layun to the front of the goal, where a sliding Gabriel Jesus just missed getting a foot on it.But Neymar, sliding in tandem just behind Jesus, didn’t miss, poking the ball into the gaping net with his right foot for his second goal in three games.The goal was the 227th for Brazil in World Cup play, breaking a tie with Germany for all-time high.Mexico, playing without a clear home-field advantage for the first time in Russia — the crowd of nearly 42,000 was evenly split — tried to come back, with Carlos Vela bending a left-footed shot toward the crossbar in the 60th minute. But Brazilian keeper Alisson lifted it over the goal for his first save of the game.He wouldn’t be called on to make another as Brazil posted its third consecutive shutout, running its scoreless streak to 310 minutes.That allowed Firmino, a second-half substitute who had come on just two minutes earlier, to tack on an insurance goal in the 88th minute. With Mexico pushing numbers forward, Neymar and Firmino were launched on a counterattack, and when Neymar’s right-footed shot from the left side strayed, Firmino was there to tap it in to secure the win.

The veteran goalkeeper leapt up, punched the air with both hands and leapt into a belly flop dive on to the rain-soaked turf as teammates raced to him from the halfway line.The World Cup's lowest-ranked team now advances to a quarterfinal against Croatia or Denmark in Sochi on Sunday.“I just feel emptied out,” Akinfeev said. “Over the whole second half and extra time we were defending our goal and managed it, we were hoping for penalties because Spain are hard to beat. Spain can't always be lucky.”It gave Russia its greatest win in international soccer for 10 years, since Akinfeev was in goal for an extra-time victory over the Netherlands in a European Championship quarterfinal. That run was ended days later by a Spain team beginning its era of dominance.Spain has now failed to win a knockout game at three major tournaments since it won Euro 2012.Defeat Sunday likely spells the end of Andres Iniesta's career. The veteran Barcelona midfielder came off the bench and almost won the game with an 85th-minute shot well saved by Akinfeev. Iniesta also scored the first spot-kick of the shootout.Spain was more urgent in extra time after being too passive when it dominated the ball in the 90 minutes of regular time.Akinfeev pushed away a 109th-minute shot from substitute Rodrigo who ran hard at goal from near the halfway line. He also ensured the game needed 30 extra minutes with back-to-back diving saves in the 85th to deny substitutes Iniesta and Aspas.Spain dominated the ball during the game — completing more than 1,000 passes — but was too passive against a well-organized Russian defense.Spain led in the 12th minute when captain Sergio Ramos helped force Russia's Sergei Ignashevich into an own goal when his back was turned to the play. The 38-year-old defender diverted a crossed ball into the net with his heel as he and Ramos got tangled up.An error in Spain's defense let Russia level in the 41st, after Gerard Pique's raised arm blocked a header by Artyom Dzyuba at a corner. Pique's complaints were wasted.

The South Americans face England on Tuesday at Spartak Stadium in Moscow. Before training on Saturday, midfielder Carlos Sanchez and backup goalkeeper also didn't shed any light on Rodriguez's recuperation. “James is a leader, but I'm also sure that if James isn't there, there are others who can step in and make the difference,” Sanchez said. “Each member of the team's squad is here to play and they have the experience.” Rodriguez missed two training sessions before Colombia's first group match against Japan and didn't start in the 2-1 loss. He was fit enough to play a full 90 minutes in the second match against Poland in the 3-0 win. With Colombia facing England on Tuesday, the possibility that Rodriguez wouldn't be fit enough to play would be a major headache for coach Jose Pekerman. “It's not a secret to anybody what James means for us, not only in football terms, but for the group. But I stand by what Carlos says,” Colombia goalkeeper Camilo Vargas said. “At the level of the national team, everyone has the hope of giving their best. “Whatever happens, all 23 players have that dream.” ","dateModified":"2018-06-30T20:02:07.891Z","datePublished":"2018-06-30T19:39:00.000Z","headline":"Colombia star James Rodriguez misses practice","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/59d59db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x576+0+53/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2Fe4%2F1983866e3acf1a2ecebefd954252%2Fla-lb-media-afp-getty-fbl-wc-2018-match48-sen-col3-20180630-123549","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#colombia-star-james-rodriguez-misses-practice"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageROUND OF 16SPAIN VS.

That’s the key,” Silva said. “If in difficult matches we start handing out goals to the opposition, things are going to be difficult for us, so we need to tighten up our defending.” The winner of the match goes on to face either Croatia or Denmark in the quarterfinals. Hierro never expected to be leading Spain into the knockout stages of this World Cup — at least not until his predecessor, Julen Lopetegui, was fired as coach two days before the tournament. Despite that disruption, Hierro said Spain has been able to do detailed research on its opponents, and Russia is no different. He stressed that his team will need to counter Russia’s physical strength and their success at set pieces. “So we need to find their weak points and where we can hurt them,” Hierro said through an interpreter. Plans can change, and he noted that Russia has switched its style since the two teams drew 3-3 last year. “We’re not going to lose any sleep over all these variables,” Hierro said. “I have done all the work I could, and I have a team which can adapt to any situation. That’s our strength.” ","dateModified":"2018-06-30T18:20:45.701Z","datePublished":"2018-06-30T18:02:00.000Z","headline":"David Silva says Spain needs to use speed against Russia","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0113dce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x576+0+53/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2Fa1%2Fa00db17db5c185d4f31c798b61c4%2Fla-lb-media-afp-getty-fbl-wc-2018-match20-iri-esp4-20180630-110103","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#david-silva-says-spain-needs-to-use-speed-against-russia"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageJavier Mascherano has announced he's retiring from the national team after Argentina was eliminated from the World Cup. “It's time to say goodbye and for the younger players to step in,” the 34-year-old midfielder said. Argentina had a 2-1 lead early in the second half, but France, often choosing to attack Mascherano, rallied to win 4-3 and become the first team to advance to the World Cup quarterfinals. Mascherano, who has played at four World Cups, made his debut for Argentina in 2003 when he still hadn't played professionally for River Plate. He holds the record for most appearances for Argentina, with 147. Now, the defensive midfielder says it’s time for a new generation to shine: “Hopefully, they can achieve something.

Four minutes later, he slotted past Armani again after he was put through on goal by a deft pass from Oliver Giroud. Mbappe also helped France to its first goal. Following a sustained period of early pressure, he won a penalty after a 40-meter burst of speed that ended with him being brought down by Marcos Rojo. Antoine Griezmann then scored from the spot in the 13th minute, sending Armani the wrong way. France will next face either Portugal or Uruguay in the quarterfinals on Friday in Nizhny Novgorod. Argentina briefly took the lead in the 48th minute at Kazan Arena, but France defender Benjamin Pavard equalized nine minutes later with a superb strike from outside the area. Argentina got its goals from Angel Di Maria, Gabriel Mercado and Sergio Aguero. Messi set up the latter two, first sending a shot on goal that Mercado deflected into the net in the 48th. With time winding down, the 31-year-old Messi gave Argentina a bit of hope with a cross to the left that Aguero headed into goal in stoppage time. Di Maria's goal was one of the best of the tournament. Following a throw-in, he hit a hard shot from 30 yards that curled into the top right corner, beyond the dive of France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. ","dateModified":"2018-06-30T16:33:00.784Z","datePublished":"2018-06-30T16:07:00.000Z","headline":"Mbappe becomes second teenager to score twice in knockout stage game as France eliminates Messi and Argentina","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5339f36/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x576+0+70/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2F26%2F872fd01eb984b61d1ad70470b2c0%2Fla-lb-media-epa-rex-round-of-16-france-vs-argentina-9731450oc-20180630-085425","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#mbappe-becomes-second-teenager-to-score-twice-in-knockout-stage-game-as-france-eliminates-messi-and-argentina"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageRoberto Martinez believes the best way to win a World Cup is to have won one before.“To be a favorite in a World Cup you need to have the know-how of winning a World Cup or have a reference of a previous generation that won the World Cup,” the Belgian coach said. “So for me there’s only five nations that [have] that.”That’s good news for Brazil, France, Spain and Argentina, who have all won World Cups since 1986 and have made it to the knockout phase in this summer’s tournament.Read More","dateModified":"2018-06-29T04:24:54.302Z","datePublished":"2018-06-29T04:35:09.374Z","headline":"World Cup’s knockout phase gives teams a second chance at greatness","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a587875/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F62%2F7c%2Ff19c650063b323ad626175e2de3d%2Fla-sp-world-cup-knockout-round-20180628","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Kevin Baxter"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#world-cups-knockout-phase-gives-teams-a-second-chance-at-greatness"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageMexico is on to the final 16 for a seventh straight World Cup, and goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa says the team should be recognized for how it got there, not for the fact that it almost tripped on its way through the door.“We are in the next round, thanks to the first two games and to the six points we got,” said Ochoa, whose team beat Germany and South Korea before getting blown out 3-0 by Sweden in the group-play finale on Wednesday, nearly ending its tournament.“We deserve the credit.

The result allowed Sweden and Mexico to advance.“I don't understand it,” said a disappointed Tim Mueller, a fan wearing a Germany T-shirt who lingered at the Fan Mile after many had left.Like many, he directed his frustration at team coach Joachim Loew, who he said pursued too much of a defensive strategy. “I think honestly Loew must resign immediately, he needs to give it up,” Mueller said. “He couldn't motivate the team and get them ready for the game.” ImageChancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert took the stiff-upper-lip approach, tweeting after the loss “Not our World Cup - that is sad! More tournaments will come where we can celebrate.”Leaving a patio bar at Berlin's Alexanderplatz, an upset Tiffany Tuchen said Germany gave up too many chances to win.“I can't believe it, my pulse was 180 the whole game, but they deserved to lose,” she said.Her friend Kerstin Fahrenholz swore off watching any of the rest of the World Cup games, lamenting: “The worst case scenario actually happened.”Berliner Juhan Szok said he was disappointed, but was trying to be optimistic.“We're out now, but there's still the European Championship,” he said, referring to the European Football Championship coming up in 2020. “Then we'll be European champions.” Image","dateModified":"2018-06-27T18:24:41.280Z","datePublished":"2018-06-27T18:07:29.000Z","headline":"Fans stunned by Germany’s World Cup elimination","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/af92d63/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+105/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2Fd5%2F161666d742da3f933454c2433991%2Fla-lb-media-epa-rex-berlin-feature-fifa-world-cup-20-9728737at-20180627-105641","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#fans-stunned-by-germanys-world-cup-elimination"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageGermany is out of the World Cup, the fourth defending champion in the last five tournaments to be eliminated in the group stage.The four-time champions lost to South Korea 2-0 in Kazan, Russia, on Wednesday, allowing a pair of injury-time goals while knowing a 1-0 victory would have been enough to advance because of the result in the other group match.Germany ended up last in Group F while Sweden and Mexico advanced to the round of 16.

South Korea later scored on an unattended goal to win 2-0.Had Germany won that game, Mexico would have become the first team to get six points in the first round of a World Cup yet fail to advance since the group-play format was adopted in 1950.Sweden got its first goal in the 50th minute when Viktor Claesson, in the center of the penalty area, chipped the ball toward the edge of the six-yard box, allowing Augustinsson to use his left foot to redirect it in off the arm of Mexican keeper Guillermo Ochoa and across the line.The second came 12 minutes later on a penalty kick by Granqvist, whose right-footed blast beat Ochoa high to the keeper’s right. The penalty kick was set up when Hector Moreno was whistled for a sliding tackle on Sweden’s Sebastian Larsson in the box.Sweden closed out the scoring in bizarre fashion in the 74th minute when Claesson sent a long throw-in into the box. The ball was headed forward, dropping behind Sweden’s Ola Toivonen before glancing off Alvarez and bouncing into the goal. Mexico, needing only a draw to win the group and advance, did not play cautiously, attacking for most of the afternoon. It had a 2 to 1 advantage in time of possession in a first half in which it also outshot Sweden. But Mexico struggled to break down a Swedish defense that kept as many as nine players behind the ball and put just one shot on goal in the first half.Sweden’s swarming defense made things even more difficult for Mexico once it took the leadThe Swedes started quickly, getting three dangerous set-piece chances in the first five minutes. On the second it took a stout two-handed save by Ochoa to keep out a strong shot by Emil Forsberg from a tough angle to the left of the six-yard box.Mexico answered with left-footed shots from Miguel Layun and Carlos Vela, but both went just wide. Mexico did catch a break in the 29th minute after a loose ball struck Javier “Chicharito” Hernandez in the arm while he was in the box, but Argentine referee Néstor Pitana, after consulting a video replay, declined to call it a hand ball.On the ensuing corner — one of three Sweden had in the first half — Ochoa came up big again, turning away a shot from Marcus Berg. The half ended with Berg putting a final left-footed shot off the side netting.But Ochoa, who has been brilliant in the tournament, had his luck run out in the second half when he didn’t get enough of Augustinsson’s shot to stop it, then guessed right on the penalty kick only to see Granqvist direct his shot perfectly into the corner.He never got close to the ball that glanced off Alvarez.","dateModified":"2018-06-27T17:04:14.438Z","datePublished":"2018-06-27T16:02:00.000Z","headline":"Mexico falls to Sweden but advances to knockout round with an assist from South Korea","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/567ffbc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2F2a%2F36a8662765ba5cd007f754dcca2e%2Fla-lb-media-afp-getty-fbl-wc-2018-match44-mex-swe6-20180627-091935","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Kevin Baxter"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#mexico-falls-to-sweden-but-advances-to-knockout-round-with-an-assist-from-south-korea"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageJesus Gallardo on Wednesday received what FIFA is calling the fastest yellow card in World Cup history.The Mexico fullback was booked for a hard tackle just 13 seconds into a match against Sweden.The record for the fastest red card still belongs to Uruguay's Jose Batista, who was sent off in the first minute against Scotland in 1986.","dateModified":"2018-06-27T15:11:53.054Z","datePublished":"2018-06-27T15:05:00.000Z","headline":"Mexico’s Jesus Gallardo picks up fastest card in World Cup history","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3e8883a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F72%2Ff5%2F2dba83ae394986dcda9b9782b073%2Fla-lb-media-afp-getty-fbl-wc-2018-match44-mex-swe3-20180627-080332","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#mexicos-jesus-gallardo-picks-up-fastest-card-in-world-cup-history"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageFielding a side filled with reserves, Croatia ended Iceland's first World Cup run with a 2-1 win in Rostov-on-Don, Russia.Milan Badelj crashed a volley against the bar, and moments later scored for Croatia in the 53rd minute, sprinting into the area to fire a bouncing shot past goalkeeper Hannes Halldorsson.Croatia playmaker Luka Modric led the already-qualified Croats for 65 minutes before being taken off, as his team remained in low gear for most of the match to contain the Icelanders, who had needed a win to hope for a place in the last 16.Iceland equalized with a penalty shot taken by Gylfi Sigurdsson in the 76th minute after substitute Dejan Lovren carelessly handled the ball.

Both Spain and Portugal had a goal difference of plus-1, but Spain scored six goals in its three group matches while Portugal had five.Spain will next face host Russia on Sunday.","dateModified":"2018-06-25T20:20:21.019Z","datePublished":"2018-06-25T20:11:00.000Z","headline":"Portugal advances after 1-1 draw with Iran","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/223bdfa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F59%2F5a%2Ffd8a797b2ea186bb95c7eeb9c1ab%2Fla-lb-media-afp-getty-topshot-fbl-wc-2018-match35-iri-por4-20180625-130024","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#portugal-advances-after-1-1-draw-with-iran"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageIt has been a difficult tournament so far for reigning champion Germany, which lost its opener to Mexico then needed a goal deep in stoppage time to beat Sweden, keeping alive its hopes of reaching the knockout round.Now it needs another win if it hopes to continue a streak of never exiting a World Cup in group play, although with the right circumstances, it could also advance with a draw.Winless South Korea also has a path — albeit a narrow one — open to the second round.

TweetIran can only advance to the next stage of the World Cup if it beats the European champions.

That forced Ronaldo to show up, which convinced supporters to leave.Then a second wave came and did not stop making noise for several hours. Police then blocked roads nearby, but the main avenue across the hotel was still open, which allowed Iran fans to keep their effort in smaller numbers.Iran fan and IT consultant Mehdi Fayez arrived Monday morning after reading messages from supporters saying they needed to trouble Portugal to stand a better chance of winning the match.“I love Ronaldo, I love Portugal, but this is a big game. We have to do all it takes,” a still joyful Fayez said as he held an Iranian flag on the back of his head.Montreh Fayoud, one of the several Iranian women attending their first World Cup, disagreed.“We were coming back from dinner and saw all these Iranians here.

Lichtsteiner also made the gesture during the match. Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri have ethnic Albanian heritage linked to Kosovo, a former Serbian province that declared independence in 2008. Serbia doesn't recognize that independence. A strict reading of FIFA's rules suggests the key trio in Switzerland's starting lineup could be ruled out until the quarterfinals. “Anyone who provokes the general public during a match will be suspended for two matches,” the FIFA disciplinary code states. FIFA's disciplinary panel could impose only a fine and warning before Switzerland plays Costa Rica on Wednesday. The Swiss need a draw to reach the round of 16. “I don't have any concerns,” Swiss soccer federation president Peter Gillieron said Sunday in an interview published by Swiss news website “20 Minutes.” Gillieron said he expected a quick decision from FIFA's judicial body, and the country could be proud of a team which has four points from two games. “It may be annoying but we have to accept it,” Gillieron said of the case. “We have to be aware that now football is just a priority.” Both the Switzerland and Serbia teams played down any political factors before the game Friday. Shaqiri had posted a photograph on Instagram of his playing boots, one with a Switzerland flag on the heel and the other with a Kosovo flag. However, a tense back-and-forth game saw Xhaka level the game in the second half and Shaqiri win it with a 90th-minute goal.

Uruguay also defeated Saudi Arabia 1-0 to secure a spot in the round of 16 as it heads into its final group match against host Russia on Monday. The team didn't say when Gimenez might return. The stalwart defense of the 23-year-old Atletico Madrid center back has been key to the team's two wins. Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez wouldn't reveal Sunday who would replace Gimenez. Russia with two wins has also qualified for the round of 16, and Monday's match will be for the top spot in Group A. Uruguay, ranked No. 14 in the world, is making its 12th overall World Cup appearance. The South American country won the tournament in 1930 as host, and again in 1950. Veteran Uruguay forward Edinson Cavani acknowledged the loss of Giminez was a blow, but he said he was confident other teammates would help fill the gap. “It is an important factor. Why? Because Jose Maria Gimenez has played at an excellent level,” Cavani said. “But as I've always said on prior occasions, this is a team. We are a team.” Gimenez has made 44 appearances with the national team since 2013. He signed with Atletico that same year. He also played in the 2014 World Cup at 19, becoming the youngest Uruguay player to appear in soccer's premier tournament. Uruguay advanced from its group in Brazil, but fell 2-0 to Colombia in the round of 16. Tabarez said it's normal to have to adjust during tournaments. He emphasized that the team was prepared. “The match plan that we always have is to continue to work — until the match begins really,” Tabarez said. “The fact that he has been injured doesn't really change anything. We have the same notion of the match and the same plan for the match as before.” ","dateModified":"2018-06-24T17:25:00.700Z","datePublished":"2018-06-24T17:10:00.000Z","headline":"Key Uruguay defender Jose Maria Gimenez ruled out for final group stage match with injury","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/584c601/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x576+0+53/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0e%2F75%2Fbb88f780ed3906fc2e1c17365603%2Fla-lb-media-apphoto-russiasoccerwcupuruguaygimenez-20180624-100637","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#key-uruguay-defender-jose-maria-gimenez-ruled-out-for-final-group-stage-match-with-injury"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageHarry Kane scored a hat trick to help England to its most one-sided World Cup victory, a 6-1 rout of Panama on Sunday that secured a place in the last 16 with a game to spare. John Stones headed in two goals and Jesse Lingard curled in another.

FIFA considers it a slur, but many supporters argue it has no discriminatory intent. Carlos Quezada, from San Luis Potosi in central Mexico, joined revelers at the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary and said he wasn't certain fans would comply with the ban. “It's the way we are. When you tell Mexicans not to do something, they keep on doing it,” he said, but added that the Mexicans were keen to repay the kindness of their Russian hosts. “People have been really, really nice to us. They have welcomed us everywhere. The Russians have been chanting for us — chanting 'Mexico, Mexico' — and it makes us feel like this is a second home.” Mexico takes on South Korea in its second Group F match after a shock 1-0 win over Germany. The Koreans lost their opener 1-0 to Sweden. Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio said he intended to continue his attacking style, would stick with core players who beat Germany, and would not get carried away with the opening win. “We hope it doesn't happen, but there would be no shame in losing to South Korea,” the Colombian said. “We all have respect for them. No matter how prepared you are, the unthinkable can always happen in every game.” Captain Andres Guardado echoed the sentiment, adding that the team had been hardened by frequent disappointments on the road to Russia — as the Mexicans vie for a quarterfinal spot, having been stopped at the last 16 in the six previous World Cups. “Beating Germany was good for us. It strengthened our [winning] mindset. But we know how dangerous praise can be. But we've had so much criticism in the past. And in those very difficult moments, we built this team. Thanks to those failures, we will stick to our dream and maybe, this time, it will be within reach.” South Korea coach Shin Tae-yong said he was worried that expected high temperatures would favor the Mexicans. The forecast is for 93 degrees on Saturday. “The change in the weather will have a negative impact on us,” he said. “I haven't seen much of the city, only what I could see on the bus coming into the city. But I noticed that it's hot and it has large fields.”  ","dateModified":"2018-06-22T18:56:02.410Z","datePublished":"2018-06-22T18:47:00.000Z","headline":"Mexico fans try new chant with eye on avoiding more fines","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/67d0b2c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x675+0+13/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7d%2Fd8%2F74a5a40d3f2e43a6950208294c8c%2Fla-lb-media-mexicofans-20180622-114526","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#mexico-fans-try-new-chant-with-eye-on-avoiding-more-fines"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageAhmed Musa gave Nigeria its first win at this year's World Cup, and kept alive Argentina’s hopes of reaching the knockout round. Musa scored two second-half goals to help the Nigerians beat Iceland 2-0 on Friday and move into second place in the group behind already-qualified Croatia. Nigeria will face Argentina in its final group match on Tuesday in St. Petersburg.

Poulsen was also given a yellow card and will be suspended for the team's final group match against France because of accumulation. The goal was Jedinak's second from the spot at this year's World Cup, and it snapped Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel's five-match streak of shutouts for the Danes. Christian Eriksen scored in the opening minutes for Denmark, which has gone unbeaten in 17 straight international matches. Going into the tournament, No. 36 Australia was the lowest-ranked team in Group C with the others all in the top 12. With a loss to France in the opener, a defeat Thursday would have made it nearly impossible for the Socceroos to advance to the next stage. Denmark, meanwhile, won its first match against Peru. Australia lost to 1998 World Cup champion France 2-1 on Saturday in Kazan, with both French goals coming as the result of video technology. But the score didn't reflect the Socceroos' gritty defensive performance. Australia again took a defensive stand against Denmark, which was back at the World Cup after missing out on the tournament in Brazil. The Danes were coming off a 1-0 victory over Peru on Saturday in Saransk. Poulsen, who plays for German club RB Leipzig, scored the lone goal. It is the fifth World Cup appearance for the Danes, who reached the quarterfinals in 1998. Australia was also making a fifth trip to the World Cup. The team's best showing was in the 2006 quarterfinals. Moments after Mathew Leckie's header for Australia sailed over the goal, Eriksen sent a left-footed shot over goalkeeper Mathew Ryan's outstretched arms. Pione Sisto nearly gave the Danes the advantage just after the halftime break, but his shot went to the right of the goal. Australia added some firepower in the 68th, bringing on 19-year-old Daniel Arzani as both teams scrambled for a winning goal. Australia lost Andrew Nabbout in the 74th minute with what appeared to be a dislocated shoulder. He was replaced by Tomi Juric. Denmark's opening victory over Peru was marred by the loss of starting midfielder William Kvist, who fractured two ribs and is likely to miss the rest of the tournament. He was replaced in the starting lineup against Australia by Lasse Schone. Denmark's last loss was in October 2016 against Montenegro, 1-0 in Copenhagen.  ","dateModified":"2018-06-21T14:33:32.497Z","datePublished":"2018-06-21T14:22:00.000Z","headline":"Australia gets crucial 1-1 draw with Denmark at World Cup","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c1ce3dd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x675+0+13/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F54%2F6e%2F6c69ab27189d2e563e6d9b068edb%2Fla-lb-media-aussiedenmarksoccer-20180621-070202","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#australia-gets-crucial-1-1-draw-with-denmark-at-world-cup"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageDiego Costa's third goal in two matches at the World Cup lifted Spain to a 1-0 win over a stubborn Iran side Wednesday. The win brought Spain even on points with Portugal in Group B after Cristiano Ronaldo and his teammates defeated Morocco on the same score line.

It could have been even earlier as the foul was committed in the 39th second — it took French referee Joel Quiniou a full 13 seconds to brandish the card. Despite having a one-man advantage for nearly the whole match, the game ended 0-0, and Scotland was eliminated. Batista, who unlike some of the other players on that Uruguay side didn't have much of a reputation as a bruiser, appears to have come to terms with his place in World Cup history. “I work at a football academy and I coach an amateur team, and I always hear, ‘You know who this guy is? He's the one that got sent off.’ So I get my phone out and show them the tackle,” Batista said in an interview posted on FIFA.com in 2016. CARLOS SANCHEZ, 2018 The Colombian holding midfielder's offense wasn't as blatant as Batista's, but he was sent off by Slovenian referee Damir Skomina for handling the ball. Sanchez had struck out his arm to stop a shot that looked bound for the Colombian net at the Mordovia Arena in Saransk. It was costly. Shinji Kagawa converted the ensuing penalty to give Japan the lead. And though Colombia managed to get back on level terms in the 39th minute with a smart free kick from Juan Quintero, Japan's man-advantage was evident in the second half. Yuya Osako sealed the win with a powerful header in the 73rd minute.  ImageGEORGIO FERRINI, 1962 The Italian's sending-off in the 1962 World Cup took place during what is arguably the dirtiest game in World Cup history. Italy versus Chile will forever be known as the “Battle of Santiago.” The 66,000 fans at Chile's national stadium witnessed spitting, two-footed challenges, punches, scuffles and even police intervention. Referee Ken Aston, who later invented the yellow and red card system in place from the 1970 World Cup, took to the field fearful of what was to come. The backdrop to the game already had added an edge to the match, with Italian reporters maligning Chile as a country. In the eighth minute, Aston sent off midfielder Georgio Ferrini for a violent foul on a Chile player. Ferrini refused to leave the field and eventually was escorted off by police. Arguably, the violence only got worse. Italy defender Mario David was also sent off after he high-kicked at Leonel Sanchez's throat. Sanchez, the son of a professional boxer, should have been sent off himself after breaking Humberto Maschio's nose with a punch. Italy, down to nine men, held on until two late goals saw Chile win 2-0. ZEZE PROCOPIO,1938 Before the “Battle of Santiago,” the match that was perhaps the most violent in World Cup history had taken place at the 1938 World Cup in France when Brazil took on Czechoslovakia. According to British journalist Brian Glanville, there was “carnage” in the quarterfinal match in Bordeaux. Zeze, a midfielder, was sent off in the 14th minute for kicking out at Czechoslovakia forward Oldrich Nejedly, who ended up with a broken leg. Also sent off were Czechoslovakia striker Jan Riha and Brazilian defender Arthur Machado for trading punches in the 89th minute. The match ended 1-1, and the two sides had to replay two days later, again in Bordeaux.

Not after Kane got England off to a perfect start with an 11th-minute tap in. But after Kyle Walker softly conceded a penalty that Ferjani Sassi converted in the 35th, many of the fouls went against England. “Maybe there was a bit of justice at the end,” Kane said. After a scoreless run at the 2016 European Championship, Kane is finally showing the predatory instinct in front of goal that has served Tottenham so well. Euro 2016 ended in humiliation for Kane and England with a loss to Iceland in the last 16, but the team has been transformed by Southgate. For all the placidness and togetherness within the group, Southgate has added persistence and doggedness. At the last World Cup, England couldn't even win a game. Low expectations for this year's overhauled team were dispelled early in Russia when Kane reacted quickly to score after John Stones' header was saved. But England struggled to finish it off. When Walker's flailing arm caught Fakhreddine Ben Youssef, a penalty was awarded and Sassi slotted it in to equalize. England's players later thought they deserved a similar call when Kane was brought down in the opposite penalty area, but the referee disagreed. Kane was pushed to ground again after the break, this time by Yassine Meriah, but again nothing was given. Kane persisted, and delivered. “You go until the last second,” Kane said, “and I'm absolutely buzzing.”  ","dateModified":"2018-06-18T21:00:31.563Z","datePublished":"2018-06-18T20:15:00.000Z","headline":"Harry Kane’s late header pushes England past Tunisia","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1973662/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x576+0+54/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fda%2Fc9%2F16a5ed6badb6b5f33c6fbee406ff%2Fla-lb-media-epa-rex-group-g-tunisia-vs-england-volg-9719480eb-20180618-130919","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#harry-kanes-late-header-pushes-england-past-tunisia"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageRomelu Lukaku scored two goals in a six-minute span and Dries Mertens put in another Monday to give Belgium a 3-0 win over Panama at the World Cup. Saddled with massive expectations and a lineup of talent the envy of others in the tournament, Belgium finally showed flashes of being the dominant team worthy of title consideration. It took a wonderful strike from Mertens to finally relieve some of the pressure.

He couldn't yet speak the language, but he sure could play.Later, my father’s passion for the beautiful game became a much-needed respite that carried him through the work week. As a child, I would tag along every Sunday to his recreational league games in Reynosa, Mexico, the neighboring border city across the river from Hidalgo, Texas, where he chose to lay our family's American roots. Nothing else mattered when he'd step on the pitch. The mortgage, bills, supporting a family of five — it's as if every worry, every bit of economic anxiety, melted away for those 90 minutes. I'd witness the weight of the world temporarily lift from his shoulders every time the referee blew the opening whistle.

After checking images of a tackle from behind by Joshua Risdon on Griezmann, referee Andres Cunha pointed to the penalty spot. “When I received the knock, I believed there was a penalty,” Griezmann said. “The referee did not blow his whistle, so I moved on with that. But when he went to see if there was a penalty, I immediately thought about how I would take it.” Griezmann hit a powerful shot that left Ryan stranded, four minutes before Jedinak then sent France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris the wrong way to put the teams level following Umtiti's clumsy foul. France had controlled possession and circulated the ball well before the interval, but after four shots in the first eight minutes the French failed to get a single shot on target in the remainder of the first half. Group DynamicsIt's the ideal start for France, whose ambition is to finish at the top of a group that also includes Peru and Denmark. A win against the South Americans next would allow France coach Didier Deschamps to rotate his players for the final game. Australia, whose goal is to survive the group stage, will need two good results to escape elimination. Key to SuccessThe French did not impress in the final third of the field and their defense often looked shaky. Umtiti made a clumsy mistake when he jumped to clear a ball with both arms raised and touched the ball with his hand to concede a penalty. But the French showed guts to secure the three points with a good pressing toward the end. Australia delivered a gritty display that bodes well for its next two matches. The team's defense is solid and they were unlucky in the end. They also have a skillful and inspired playmaker in Aaron Mooy. Super SubsGiroud and midfielder Blaise Matuidi had a big impact after coming in as substitutes during the second half. Giroud delivered the assist that led to Pogba's goal, and Matuidi added some strength and pace in midfield after France looked bereft of ideas in that sector for long spells. Mbappe the YoungestKylian Mbappe became the youngest player to represent France at a World Cup at 19 years, 178 days. He was 10 months younger than Bruno Bellone, who played at the 1982 World Cup in Spain. ","dateModified":"2018-06-16T17:28:27.853Z","datePublished":"2018-06-16T14:08:00.000Z","headline":"Goal line technology helps France secure 2-1 win over Australia","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fec5631/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x576+0+53/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5f%2Fb2%2F08295108c265bcc0de0b8a648866%2Fla-lb-media-apphoto-russiasoccerwcupfranceaustralia2-20180616-070644","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#goal-line-technology-helps-france-secure-2-1-win-over-australia"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe World Cup opener in Moscow drew a rabid crowd of more than 78,000 Thursday, but the tournament wasn’t as warmly embraced in Yekaterinburg, where Friday’s game between Egypt and Uruguay was watched by wide swaths of empty seats.Attendance at Yekaterinburg Arena was listed at 27,015, more than 6,000 below capacity, although that appeared to be a very generous account given the vast number of empty seats visible on TV.

Nacho Fernandez then put the 2010 champions ahead with a one-timer from outside the area in the Group B match.Spain looked to have successfully overcome its dramatic coaching change on the eve of the tournament but Ronaldo curled a late shot over the wall to force the draw.Ronaldo's opening goal from the penalty spot allowed him to become the fourth player to score in four World Cups, joining Pele, Miroslav Klose and Uwe Seeler. Ronaldo also became the first Portuguese player to appear in four World Cups.His second goal came after a blunder by Spain goalkeeper David de Gea, who let the ball bounce off his hands and into the net.Spain badly needed a winning start after the federation fired coach Julen Lopetegui two days before its tournament debut for accepting a job with Real Madrid without letting it know in advance. Sporting director Fernando Hierro, a former player, was picked as Lopetegui's replacement and was on the bench despite no significant previous coaching experience.It was an exciting start to one of the group-stage's most anticipated matches and it didn't take long before Ronaldo and Portugal struck first.Ronaldo made a nice stepover move to get past Fernandez, his Real Madrid teammate, and was fouled at the edge of the area. He then calmly sent his shot to the right corner as De Gea went the other way.During the celebration, Ronaldo rubbed his chin in an apparent reaction to Adidas' “GOAT” promotion with Lionel Messi. GOAT is the acronym for “greatest of all time” and Adidas is running an advertisement featuring Messi with a real goat.As Ronaldo returned to midfield for the restart, he and Fernandez appeared to exchange words and the Portuguese star smiled.Portugal threatened on counterattacks as Spain struggled to get near Rui Patricio's goal, but a great long pass by Sergio Busquets allowed Costa to even the match. The striker beat defender Pepe to the ball and used several neat moves to clear defenders before firing a low shot into the corner from inside the area.Portugal loudly complained for a foul by Costa on Pepe, and replays showed there was contact by the Spaniard's arm with Pepe's body, but referee Gianluca Rocchi allowed the play to continue. Portugal wanted the play to be reviewed, and Rocchi at one point put his hand to his ear, apparently indicating that the assistant referees didn't see a clear error.Goal-line technology came into play a few moments later when a Francisco “Isco” Alarcon's shot struck the crossbar and dropped straight down on top of the goal line. After Isco complained, Rocchi pointed to his watch, which is where he gets goal-line technology confirmations.Busquets and Costa teamed up again for Spain's equalizer in the 55th. After a cross by Andres Iniesta, Busquets headed the ball back across the area and Costa touched it into the open net.Three minutes later, Fernandez redeemed himself for the penalty on Ronaldo with a streaking shot after a ball cleared by the defense got deflected toward him. The ball struck the post before going into the goal.","dateModified":"2018-06-15T21:01:27.069Z","datePublished":"2018-06-15T20:14:00.000Z","headline":"Cristiano Ronaldo scores hat trick in Portugal’s 3-3 draw with Spain","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff2bc75/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2F0e%2Fda587f3a90164216e5a24c7703b8%2Fla-lb-media-afp-getty-topshot-fbl-wc-2018-match3-por-esp-20180615-131121","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#cristiano-ronaldo-scores-hat-trick-in-portugals-3-3-draw-with-spain"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageMexican soccer rules in much of the U.S., at least as far as World Cup jersey sales are concerned. According to a map released by soccer.com, Mexico is the site’s top-selling soccer jersey among teams that qualified for the World Cup in 23 of the 50 states.

Australia hasn’t improved much since. France, a tournament favorite, features an attack that includes Paul Pogba, Olivier Giroud and Antoine Griezmann.

Argentina and Lionel Messi, World Cup finalists four years ago, meet tournament debutante Iceland, the smallest nation ever to qualify for the event. Iceland isn’t a team to be overlooked — it made the quarterfinals in its first European Championship two years ago — but the pressure here is clearly on Argentina and Messi, who needs a title to cement his legacy as one of the best players of all time.Croatia vs. NigeriaWhere: KaliningradTime: noon PDTTV: FS1, TelemundoThe buzz: Croatia is one of the best teams in the tournament, although one few people are playing attention to. With a lineup that features Luka Modric, Mario Mandzukic, Ivan Rakitic, Mateo Kovacic and Ivan Perisic, it can score in bunches, and after conceding just five goals in 12 games in UEFA qualifying, the defense looks stingy. Nigeria has a number of physically gifted players in Victor Moses, Alex Iwobi and Kelechi Iheanacho, but the Super Eagles are searching for a reliable keeper and there are concerns about the defense.","dateModified":"2018-06-15T19:46:05.644Z","datePublished":"2018-06-15T19:00:00.000Z","headline":"World Cup: Saturday’s matchups","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9820c3b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fab%2F34%2Fae6911aada6ac694e8444927e447%2Fla-1529004014-yf193m8km6-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Kevin Baxter"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#world-cup-saturdays-matchups"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageAziz Bouhaddouz headed a free kick into his own net in the fifth minute of injury time to gift Iran a 1-0 victory over Morocco on Friday at the World Cup.Only on the field as a 77th-minute substitute, the Morocco striker dived to reach a curling cross from the left, trying to knock it out of play, but headed the ball into the net past goalkeeper Monir El Kajoui.Full coverage of the 2018 World Cup »There was an explosion of joy among the Iran squad, with coaching staff and substitutes sprinting onto the field and jumping for joy.It was only Iran's second win in 13 matches at the World Cup, and the first by an Asian team since the 2010 tournament in South Africa.For L.A.'s Iranian American community, the World Cup means much more than soccer games »With Spain and Portugal the other teams in Group B, Friday's match in St. Petersburg was regarded as a must-win game for both Iran and Morocco.","dateModified":"2018-06-15T17:45:22.004Z","datePublished":"2018-06-15T17:18:00.000Z","headline":"Own-goal during injury time earns Iran 1-0 win over Morocco","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/265a3ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x675+0+13/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F2b%2F344348db1ac57bbdc373fed98d71%2Fla-lb-media-epa-rex-group-b-morocco-vs-iran-stpete-9717352fu-20180615-101537","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#own-goal-during-injury-time-earns-iran-1-0-win-over-morocco"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageAt a recent World Cup warm-up match at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Mexico’s national soccer team was missing one of its biggest stars: Rafael Marquez, the team’s captain and a legendary defender.Marquez, a four-time World Cup veteran, was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department last year for allegedly aiding a powerful Mexican drug trafficker.

They made some more with the result, Russia’s first World Cup win in 16 years.And the victory marked a big first step toward what could be even more history since a win or draw in either of its next two games could carry Russia beyond the group stage for the first time since the break-up of the Soviet Union.Read More","dateModified":"2018-06-14T20:34:28.220Z","datePublished":"2018-06-14T17:19:00.000Z","headline":"Russia beats Saudi Arabia 5-0 for first World Cup win in 16 years","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ce490b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+104/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe1%2F0f%2F9f99f416834795057066e02a878c%2Fla-lb-media-apphoto-russiasoccerwcuprussiasaudiarabia-20180614-132347","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Kevin Baxter"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#russia-beats-saudi-arabia-5-0-for-first-world-cup-win-in-16-years"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Tweet Tweet Tweet","dateModified":"2018-06-14T15:51:19.542Z","datePublished":"2018-06-14T15:36:00.000Z","headline":"And the 2018 World Cup is underway!","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-updates-20180612-htmlstory.html#and-the-2018-world-cup-is-underway"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageGROUP AEGYPT VS.

He also has a ruthless grip on Chechnya. He has sought to obliterate any kind of political advocacy or human rights work.”Salah has yet to comment on the controversial encounter, which caused a stir on social media. When asked about it by the Associated Press on Monday, Egyptian national team director Eihab Leheita said, “Ask FIFA for a comment.”Two members of the German national team also are receiving considerable backlash for posing in a picture with another world leader. Mesut Ozil and Ilkay Gundogan, who were both born in Germany but are of Turkish descent, stood with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for a photo op in London last month. TweetGermany has a strained relationship with Erdogan, who is moving to consolidate and extend his power after 15 years leading Turkey.Gundogan received boos and whistles from portions of the home crowd during Germany’s friendly against Saudi Arabia in Leverkusen last week. Ozil did not play because of a knee injury.\"A lot of things rained down on Mesut and me in the past two weeks. It continues to be a difficult situation for us. It's still on our minds, on my mind,\" Gundogan said on German television Tuesday.\"That's why it hurts when there are accusations like that we are not integrated [into German society] or that we don't live by German values.\"I believe we both have done a lot for it, have tried to be role models, be respectful, be tolerant. Those two weeks were incredibly difficult.\"It's still not over. You could all hear the whistles at us in the last match. It's never nice. Not for me, not for my teammates.
