On the other hand, another neighbor of mine was an actual police officer.\"Moore, best known for his long run on the CBS procedural \"Criminal Minds,\" noted the diversity of the cast and creative team and added that, while the show is primarily designed to entertain, it will also resonate politically. \"We’re taking on the Trump years,\" he said. \"I don’t care who you voted for. It’s just what’s happening today. It’s Black Lives Matter. As much as some people don’t want to hear it, it’s All Lives Matter. It’s not just black versus blue or black versus white. It’s every ethnicity. It’s fear. It’s racism. It’s terrorism. It’s subject matter of today.\"Ryan, who created the groundbreaking drama \"The Shield,\" about corrupt Los Angeles police officers, said he was excited about the chance to examine the often charged relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve. \"Los Angeles is such a diverse, amazing community, and seeing an officer who kind of lives in the city and sort of sees the people that are being policed as humans and as neighbors and as friends was really important to me.\" ","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:55:05.382Z","datePublished":"2017-08-02T01:20:00.000Z","headline":"CBS’ ‘S.W.A.T.’ reboot ‘will take on the Trump years,’ #BlackLivesMatter, says Shemar Moore","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2e4622f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+84/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F18%2Ff9%2F2f81aab92bf35b31b61515895767%2Fla-1501612765-0prawfoefq-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Meredith Blake"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#cbs-s-w-a-t-reboot-will-take-on-the-trump-years-blacklivesmatter-says-shemar-moore"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"What do you get when you pair up a living legend with a bunch of little kids? Comedy gold, if Netflix has its way.The online streaming service announced Monday that comedy icon Carol Burnett will be returning to television with \"A Little Help With Carol Burnett,\" an original unscripted series that pairs Burnett with children to tackle life's dilemmas. “Someone once asked me how old I am inside,” Burnett said in a statement Monday. “I thought about it and came up with, ‘I’m about 8.’ So it’s going to be a lot of fun playing with kids my age.”Kids ages 4 to 8 will join Burnett as celebrities and everyday folks bring their real-life problems to the show to get advice in front of a live studio audience. “We’re thrilled Carol is bringing her unique sensibilities to Netflix,” Bela Bajaria, the service's vice president of content acquisition, said in Monday's announcement. “Carol is truly a legend in the entertainment industry with unprecedented success and fandom across TV, film and the stage, and we are both honored and excited to work with her.”\"A Little Help With Carol Burnett\" will be produced by Dick Clark Productions and is the company's first Netflix project. This is the second television project announced this year for Burnett, 84. In February, ABC ordered a pilot for the multi-camera comedy \"Household Name,\" starring Burnett, though the series has not been picked up in its current iteration.Debuting in 2018, \"A Little Help With Carol Burnett\" will feature 12 half-hour episodes.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:59:20.500Z","datePublished":"2017-08-01T00:30:00.000Z","headline":"Netflix getting ‘A Little Help’ from Carol Burnett","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Libby Hill"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#netflix-getting-a-little-help-from-carol-burnett"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"To lift a line from the pop song \"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye,\" go ahead and kiss Anthony Scaramucci goodbye.It's been a robust 10 days since the former Goldman Sachs investment banker, affectionately known as \"the Mooch,\" started his new job as White House communications director. And what a whirlwind 10 days they were.During that time, Scaramucci's estranged wife, Deirdre Ball, gave birth to their second child. Scaramucci was not present for the birth, busy as he was at his new job in Washington, D.C. On Wednesday, Scaramucci lashed out on Twitter at then White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, seemingly implying that Priebus had leaked a publicly available financial disclosure form to Politico, tagging both the FBI and Justice Department in the tweet.On Thursday, Scaramucci took to the CNN morning show \"New Day\" to continue his attack on Priebus. Later that day, New Yorker magazine writer Ryan Lizza confirmed that Scaramucci had spoken to him via phone Wednesday night and called Priebus a \"paranoid schizophrenic\" and had, somehow, even worse (vulgar) things to say about White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon. All of which led to Priebus' unceremonious dismissal from his position on Friday, with the White House announcing that former general and current Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly would be replacing him.Hopefully, Scaramucci enjoyed his weekend because it took only a few hours Monday before it was announced that he was the latest ouster in the revolving door that is the Trump administration. In a statement released Monday, the White House said it \"felt it was best to give Chief of Staff Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team.\" Twitter, unsurprisingly, is beside itself.Here are a few choice takes from social media.

As a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, he penned classic off-Broadway plays including \"True West,\" \"Buried Child\" and \"Fool for Love.\"An Oscar-nominated actor, he starred in films including \"Days of Heaven,\" \"The Right Stuff,\" \"Crimes of the Heart\" and \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.\"To fans of underground music, however, Shepard served a lesser-known role as the drummer for seminal New York avant-garde folk band the Holy Modal Rounders, with whom he performed on the crucial late 1960s albums \"Indian War Whoop\" and \"The Moray Eels Eat the Holy Modal Rounders.\" The band is best known for its song \"If You Want to Be a Bird,\" which plays during the classic scene in \"Easy Rider\" in which Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda and Jack Nicholson roar down the highway on their motorcycles. That's Shepard playing drums as Rounders founders Peter Stampfel and Steve Weber whoop and yowl.It was in his capacity as a percussionist, in fact, that he drew the attention of a young Patti Smith, who, in her 2010 memoir \"Just Kids,\" recounted their first early '70s meeting at seminal music club the Village Gate.  Escorted to the club by Todd Rundgren, who had just issued his album \"Runt,\" Smith described the Holy Modal Rounders' set as \"like being at an Arabian hoedown with a band of psychedelic hillbillies. I was fixed on the drummer, who seemed as if he was on the lam and had slid behind the drums while cops looked elsewhere.\" Smith, who at the time was freelancing for Crawdaddy magazine, introduced herself to this drummer, who said his name was Slim Shadow.The two started hanging out, wrote Smith, describing his tales as being \"even taller than mine. He had an infectious laugh and was rugged, smart, and intuitive. In my mind, he was the fellow with the cowboy mouth.\" Only later did she learn Slim's real identity when a friend pulled her aside after seeing them at a restaurant together. As recounted in \"Just Kids,\" Smith wrote that her friend asked, \"What are you doing with Sam Shepard?\" \"Sam Shepard?\" I said. \"Oh, no, this guy's name is Slim.\"\"Honey, don't you know who he is?\"\"He's the drummer for the Holy Modal Rounders.\" No, corrected her friend, \"He's the biggest playwright off-Broadway. He had a play at Lincoln Center. He won five Obies!\"Once she learned of his reputation and acclaim, Smith and Shepard continued to see each other -- despite his being married at the time -- and eventually collaborated on a play called \"Cowboy Mouth.\" Smith described telling him of nervousness at writing for the stage, which she had never done. But Shepard urged her on, Smith wrote, telling her that \"you can't make a mistake when you improvise.\"Replied Smith: \"What if I screw up the rhythm?\"\"You can't,\" Shepard explained. \"It's like drumming. If you miss a beat, you create another.\"7:15 a.m. Updated to correct the title of Smith's memoir, \"Just Kids,\" and to identify the Holy Modal Rounders' co-founders, Stampfel and Weber.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:48:33.362Z","datePublished":"2017-07-31T17:28:00.000Z","headline":"Sam Shepard: Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, actor and ... avant-garde drummer?","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07363be/2147483647/strip/true/crop/682x384+0+320/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F23%2Fdf%2F5a96a18aa083f293dbaf7dafa5db%2Fimg-597f65d3-turbine-la-sam-shepard-20170731","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Randall Roberts"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#sam-shepard-pulitzer-prize-winning-playwright-actor-and-avant-garde-drummer"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe ongoing offstage drama between the pop singer Kesha and her former producer Dr. Luke has entangled another platinum superstar: Lady Gaga.On Saturday, attorneys for Dr. Luke, whose real name is Lukasz Gottwald, issued a statement regarding their attempt to depose Lady Gaga about relevant conversations she may have had with Kesha.The artist, who was born Kesha Sebert, is the subject of a defamation suit filed in New York by Dr. Luke stemming from allegations of sexual misconduct, which the producer vigorously denies.The statement reads:“Dr. Luke’s counsel served a subpoena on Lady Gaga because she has relevant information regarding, among other things, false statements about Dr. Luke made to her by Kesha. This motion has become necessary because Dr. Luke’s counsel has not been able to obtain, despite repeated request [sic], a deposition date from Lady Gaga.” ImageRepresentatives for Gaga, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, said in a statement issued to The Times on Monday morning: \"As Lady Gaga's legal team will present to the court, she has provided all of the relevant information in her possession and is at most an ancillary witness in this process.

Last year, Gaga wrote about her peer's plight in an Instagram post: \"The very reason women don't speak up for years is the fear that no one will believe them or their abuser has threatened their life or life of their loved ones/livelihood in order to keep their victim quiet and under control. What happened to Kesha has happened to many female artists, including myself, and it will affect her for the rest of her life.\" The news comes at a particularly crucial moment for Kesha's career. On Aug. 11, she will release her highly anticipated new album, \"Rainbow.\" The record, featuring songs such as \"Learn to Let Go,\" will arrive via Dr. Luke's imprint, Kemosabe, a situation Kesha sought to avoid in a 2014 lawsuit of her own, which she later dropped.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:48:57.983Z","datePublished":"2017-07-31T17:09:00.000Z","headline":"Lady Gaga subpoenaed in producer Dr. Luke’s lawsuit against pop singer Kesha","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d75b8dc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe4%2F57%2Fb089c5c09d3965bf86b5f9f24ac6%2Fla-et-ms-lady-gaga-joanne-20161021-snap","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Randall Roberts"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#lady-gaga-subpoenaed-in-producer-dr-lukes-lawsuit-against-pop-singer-kesha"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageSam Shepard — Oscar-nominated actor and critically acclaimed playwright, author, screenwriter and director — died on July 27 after suffering complications from  ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).

There is no Plan B for that,\" Kerger said of the potential budget crisis public broadcasting faces under the Trump administration.The Corporation for Public Broadcasting has been under fire for months, with President Trump's proposed budget axing the institution's $450-million budget. Though it's easy to suggest that budget cuts would threaten Big Bird's livelihood, the true victims of defunding would be far more human.Kerger explained that of PBS' $450-million budget, one-third goes to radio. Of the television budget, most goes to community service grants that local stations use for up to 50% of their operating budgets. \"PBS itself will not go away. But a number of our stations will.

The cable network also has three other installments in development: “History of Video Games,” “Outlaws of the Internet,” and “History of Martial Arts.” The new “Visionaries” members join the previously announced programs “Robert Kirkman’s Secret History of Comics” and “James Cameron’s Story of Science Fiction.”Kirkman and Roth were present at the AMC panel with Cameron appearing via satellite to show sneak peeks from the comics and sci-fi iterations of the series.A sizzle reel for the “Secret History of Comics” utilized plenty of classic panel pages and a sort of motion comic-like animation to illustrate the early days of Marvel Comics, going all the way back to the Stan Lee and Jack Kirby days. But the real treat was a collection of cameos, famous faces opining about their love of the form including Lee himself, J.K. Simmons, Kevin Smith, and Method Man, who earnestly revealed, “You have to be born a comic book fan, I think.”  And there are plenty more talking heads to come, the AMC press release promised Patty Jenkins, Lynda Carter, Famke Janssen, Michelle Rodriguez, and Todd McFarlane. The second clip shared a look at Cameron’s love letter to science fiction. “Today, science fiction is mainstream but it didn’t used to be that way,” the director explained. “When I was a kid science fiction wasn’t cool, but I thought it was cool.” Cameron wants to focus on closing the gap between current fans' knowledge of modern day sci-fi to the pioneering works of literature that inspired the blockbuster offerings of today. The \"Terminator\" and \"Avatar\" director noted that without Jules Verne and H.G. Wells there would be no Avengers, “Star Wars” or his own works. The series will be divided by theme -- space travel, time travel etc.--  and include appearances from Paul W. Anderson, Roland Emmerich, Paul Verhoeven, Bryan Singer, Keanu Reeves, Jonathan Nolan, David Gerrold and D.C. Fontana. When asked how their respective series would showcase diversity -- the footage screened was very male-centric -- Kirkman responded that “History of Comics” would have two episodes devoted to diversity. One will focus on the women who helped Wonder Woman creator William Moulton Marston steer the course of the hugely famous female superhero, and another highlighting people of color titled “The Color of Comics.” The episode \"explores the history of black characters, and the lack of black characters in the comic book industry,” said Kirkman. “which touches on the creation of Black Panther — the Marvel character — and does a really cool focus on this company called Milestone Comics that was founded by a group of African American comic book creators to create characters that appealed to them and represented them, because there was a huge lack of representation in comics even in the '90s.” “You wouldn’t have horror without Mary Shelley and 'Frankenstein,'” Roth added. He cited the late George Romero as an example of how he wants to break down the themes within the horror genre. “At the height of the civil rights movement [Romero] puts an African American as the lead of ‘Night of the Living Dead’ and at the end of the movie he’s shot by a bunch of rednecks. Not because of the color of his skin, but because they think he’s a zombie. But you can read into the implications of that. What [Romero] was doing with using genre to explore racism was so ahead of its time. it’s just as potent today as it was 50 years ago. It’s absolutely something we’re going to be discussing.” Roth’s urgency to document the horror masters was apparent. It was the death of “Scream” moviemaker Wes Craven that inspired Roth to get involved in \"Visionaries.\"The panel then took a turn for the analytical when the creators were asked how their series would reflect the world today.“The fact that dystopian science fiction has come back, especially in television and in movies, is very important,” said Cameron. “It means that in the age that we live in right now the challenges that face us are technological. They’re science challenges: climate change, genetics, artificial intelligence, things like that. These are really on our horizon as major, existential threats.” “The best horror reflects what’s going on in our times,” said Roth. He used Jordan Peele's \"Get Out” — which addressed modern day racial tensions— as a reference. “It’s no accident that movie coming out right now is making over $200 million at the box office. You can tell it’s really resonating with people.”Bouncing off Cameron’s dystopia revelation, Roth then turned his lens onto the current political climate, “I don’t think we’ve ever seen a cast of characters like this in our White House that’s straight out of WWF wrestling in the '80s. When [Anthony Scaramucci] is coming out with things that would make 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper in his heyday blush. This is a farce, is this actually happening?” When will we start seeing this dystopian outlook on the current political climate in the movies? Possibly before Roth's series, which will air sometime in 2018, after \"History of Comics\" and the \"Story of Science Fiction\" in 2017. ","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:54:14.463Z","datePublished":"2017-07-30T17:14:00.000Z","headline":"‘AMC Visionaries’ adds Eli Roth, Roots, Gibney for new docu-series","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/20d6f45/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F37%2F19%2F7ae163267efbaceef0af1161e460%2Fla-et-hc-amc-eli-roth-robert-kirkman-20170729","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Meredith Woerner"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#amc-visionaries-adds-eli-roth-roots-gibney-for-new-docu-series"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Image QuoteFROM THE ARCHIVES: REAL HOLLYWOOD MUSCLE: No Star Makes More Money, Wields More Power or Has More Fun","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:56:45.168Z","datePublished":"2017-07-30T15:00:00.000Z","headline":"A Star Is Born: Arnold Schwarzenegger turns 70 today","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3e4cd80/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F2b%2F058e7ce49e6265ceac4b50b7544b%2Fimg-597abac0-turbine-la-et-arnold-schwartzenegger-photo","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Los Angeles Times Staff"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#a-star-is-born-arnold-schwarzenegger-turns-70-today"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders took time during a White House briefing this week to read a fan letter to President Trump from a 9-year-old boy named Dylan who has the nickname of \"Pickle.\"Sanders read part of the letter to reporters: \"You're my favorite President ...

Patinkin was to join the cast for a limited run from Aug. 15 through Sept. 3, but declined the part because he \"would never accept a role knowing it would harm another actor.\"\"I hear what members of the community have said and I agree with them. I am a huge fan of Oak and I will, therefore, not be appearing in the show,\" the \"Homeland\" alum tweeted.Another tweet on the show's account included an apology to Patinkin \"for any misunderstanding\" and said they understood his decision to withdraw from the show. Tweet TweetOnaodowan, who had replaced recording artist Josh Groban in the role of Pierre earlier this month, is scheduled to continue to perform through Aug. 13, after which, he stated Friday on Twitter, he will not return to the show. It is unclear if his decision to leave the production was his own or prompted by other factors.Show creator Dave Malloy, whose musical was inspired by a portion of Leo Tolstoy's \"War and Peace,\" also apologized Friday on Twitter for \"how everything went down\" and missing the “racial optics\" of their casting decision.They had previously asked actress Brittain Ashford to step aside for the casting of better-known singer-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson during the summer months and they didn't anticipate that Patinkin's casting would be viewed differently, Malloy said.Despite 12 Tony Award nominations, \"Comet\" only received two wins -- for set and lighting -- at the June ceremony and ticket sales ebbed when Groban departed.Malloy said that sales for shows after Aug. 13, when Michaelson's run would also end, were \"catastrophically low.\" So they decided to cast Patinkin, hoping that his star power would help boost sales, because the \"weird show\" was in \"desperate shape\" and on the brink of closing.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:48:17.805Z","datePublished":"2017-07-29T22:51:00.000Z","headline":"Broadway’s ‘Great Comet’ producer apologizes for controversial Mandy Patinkin casting","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/496c26f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x675+0+63/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2Fb9%2F9d9a886b094c92c7569065d1a0e5%2Fla-et-mg-mandy-patinkin-sag-awards-2014-homela-001","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Nardine Saad"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#broadways-great-comet-producer-apologizes-for-controversial-mandy-patinkin-casting"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Image QuoteFROM THE ARCHIVES: Documentary Maker Follows His Own Path in Celebrating History","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:00:57.938Z","datePublished":"2017-07-29T15:00:00.000Z","headline":"A Star Is Born: Ken Burns turns 64 today","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7b7be62/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F16%2Fda%2F67c66fc9d99231f6e60c94510a80%2Fimg-59772009-turbine-la-et-ken-burns-photo","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Los Angeles Times Staff"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#a-star-is-born-ken-burns-turns-64-today"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe Eagles’“Classic” music festival series will continue with at least one more stop, this time in Seattle.But unlike the inaugural Classic West bill July 15-16 at Dodger Stadium, which is having a Classic East encore this weekend in New York, the added Classic Northwest show on Sept. 30 will be just a single day and feature the Eagles and Doobie Brothers only.The Classic West and East shows teamed the Eagles, Steely Dan and Doobie Brothers on one day, with Fleetwood Mac, Journey and Earth, Wind & Fire on the second day of each.Tickets for the Classic Northwest bill go on sale Aug. 5 at 10 a.m. at Ticketmaster.At the outset of the Eagles’ portion of Classic West on July 15, co-founder Don Henley indicated it was still uncertain how much of a future his long-running band might have absent co-founder Glenn Frey, who died last year at 67.To make the Classic West and East shows possible, the group tapped Frey’s son, singer-guitarist Deacon Frey, and country music star Vince Gill to handle the lead vocals on the many Eagles songs that were originally sung by Glenn Frey.“In case this is our last dance,” Henley told the crowd at Dodger Stadium, where he was joined by longtime bandmates Joe Walsh and Timothy B.

They’re brilliant. They’re funny.

But what's important is that it's funny.\"Although the exact format of the show is still being refined, Silverman did reveal some elements, including a monologue, a focus group in the studio and field pieces in which she travels around the country talking to people.

On Thursday, the series shared the official poster for the series, and it is super messed up.The poster features a deathly pale woman who happens to be missing the top of her head and, for that matter, her brain. Instead, the inside of her head is a honeycomb, replete with bees and, of course, honey.This is creepy for so many reasons. Here are a few:This poor woman has had the top of her skull removed, bringing to mind that particularly gruesome dinner scene featuring Anthony Hopkins and Ray Liotta in the 2001 film \"Hannibal.\"Even more horrifying is that this poor, sweet woman is definitely dressed like a clown.The white makeup, lines through the eyes and exaggerated ruby red lips suggest that \"AHS: Cult\" is drawing inspiration from traditional grotesque whiteface clown makeup.

He thinks his own communications director is gonna stab him in the back again,” Colbert said with an exaggerated Italian accent.“Front stab!” he added with a knifing gesture.The New Yorker article also detailed how Scaramucci accused Bannon of seeking to “build [his] own brand off the … strength of the president” and made some other inflammatory remarks that we can't fully detail.

Messina, who hasn't been a series regular since Season 4, is set to return for multiple episodes.And while the Season 5 finale ended with Mindy marrying boyfriend Ben (Bryan Greenberg), hints were thrown that the new episodes would bring some clarity to the Mindy-Danny relationship.\"The one thing we can promise the audience is a little bit of clarity about where they stand,\" Warburton said. \"It's so great to see him back because we’ve always known they're always going to be in each other's lives … but it's great to actually see what that means this season.\"\"It's complicated,\" added Kaling. \"They're both married to other people, so we went into that season with all of that, which makes things sort of fun and delicious.\"Other familiar faces set to return for the final season are Mark and Jay Duplass, Adam Pally and Glenn Howerton.Kaling, in discussing the decision to end the series, promised a good finale.\"The decision to end the show was our decision, and I think that's always very hard,\" Kaling said. \"It was like, God, should this be the end? ...

Newly sprung from prison after serving 15 years, he has to acclimate to the changed times, his gentrified Brooklyn neighborhood and his former girlfriend (Tiffany Haddish of \"Girls Trip\") raising the children he didn't know existed with another man.\"This is a show about humanity, this is a show about second chances, this is a show about redemption,\" said Morgan, answering a question about whether it would explicitly explore  African American issues. \"I wanted to transcend that... I wanted to deal with humanity.\" Haddish, naturally, fielded several questions about \"Girls Trip,\" the new comedy film that has minted her as a star. \"I feel like a foster kid who's been in the system for a long time and then turned 16 and somebody adopted them and said, 'You can go to college and you ain't got to pay no school loans or nothing,' \" she said of how she's been feeling in the wake of the film's superb box office. \"I'm happy! I've been accepted finally after all these years of hard work, blood, sweat and tears.\"  Haddish said she was looking forward to her role in \"The Last O.G.\" since it's a character who has gone through a transition in her life, just as she herself has. Her fellow cast mates, including Cedric the Entertainer, good-naturedly ribbed her about becoming a diva since she's now a movie star. But Morgan noted seriously that Haddish has been nothing but a pro: \"She comes to work.\"Haddish joked: \"My bank account, it don't show movie star yet. I'm waiting on it. They say nine months; it's like a baby. I'm waiting for the delivery.\"Morgan said it was important to surround himself with scene stealers such as Haddish and Cedric and was clearly earnest in his appreciation of his collaborators and their sensitivity to his physical needs.\"They make sure I sit down... they don't ask me, they [say] sit down for a little while.

Now he's riding it all the way to premium cable.On Thursday, Showtime announced it had ordered 10 episodes of an as-yet-untitled animated series featuring cartoon renderings of the president, his family and inner circle. The satirical half-hour series, executive produced by Colbert and \"The Late Show's\" show runner Chris Licht, will debut on Showtime this fall. According to the network, turnaround on the series will be quick in order to incorporate current events. “Stephen and Chris have an uncanny genius for deconstructing the world of President Trump, and this series opens a new realm for them,” Showtime President David Nevins said in a press statement.Tim Luecke, who co-created the animated version of Trump who frequently appears in \"Late Show\" bits — including a recent segment from the notorious presidential suite of the Moscow Ritz-Carlton — will serve as lead animator.The announcement caps off a period of good news for Colbert, who racked up six Emmy nominations this month and will be hosting the awards in September.

The film stars Kate Winslet, Justin Timberlake, Juno Temple and James Belushi in a story set around Coney Island in the 1950s.But that wasn’t the only Allen item of the day. Variety reported that “Wonder Wheel” will also be the first film fully distributed by Amazon when it opens in theaters on Dec. 1. The company has already made fast inroads to the movie business, winning Academy Awards this year for “Manchester by the Sea” and “The Salesman,” but has up to now worked with established distribution partners such as Roadside Attractions or Bleecker Street to help get those movies into theaters.Amazon released Allen’s 2016 film, “Cafe Society,” starring Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart and Steve Carell, in partnership with Lionsgate. The online giant also released Allen’s six-part “Crisis in Six Scenes,” in which he starred alongside Elaine May and Miley Cyrus, late last year via the Amazon Prime Video streaming service.The move by Amazon is yet another way the company is distinguishing itself in relation to streaming rival Netflix. Where Netflix has been seen as pulling back from theatrical distribution, opting for either extremely limited or no theatrical release at all of its titles to drive viewers to its own platform, this latest push by Amazon renews its commitment to traditional theatrical releases.The New York Film Festival slot for “Wonder Wheel” gives Amazon the three marquee spots at the showcase. Previously announced, Richard Linklater’s “Last Flag Flying” will open the festival, and Todd Haynes' “Wonderstruck,” which premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival, will show in the centerpiece slot.Other upcoming Amazon titles include Mike White’s “Brad’s Status,” starring Ben Stiller, and Luca Guadagnino’s remake of “Suspiria,” starring Dakota Johnson.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:49:04.105Z","datePublished":"2017-07-27T20:17:00.000Z","headline":"Woody Allen’s ‘Wonder Wheel’ to complete Amazon’s turn to full-service distribution","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/641a84e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+91/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6a%2F12%2F06f896c99cd33825684d7ff532f8%2Fla-et-mn-american-film-institute-s-45th-life-achievement-award-gala-tribute-to-diane-keaton-roaming-show-20170727","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Mark Olsen"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#woody-allens-wonder-wheel-to-complete-amazons-turn-to-full-service-distribution"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageMick Jagger has been looking to the past on recent albums and festival dates.

there's one upside to the Trump administration's early-morning Twitter proclamations, it's that it gives late-night shows all day to craft their reactions.Wednesday began with President Trump announcing a ban on transgender individuals serving in the United States military and ended with late-night hosts uniformly blasting the policy decision in hilarious fashion. On \"The Late Show,\" Stephen Colbert had plenty to say about Trump's tweets, which ended with an uncharacteristic \"thank you.\"\"Thank you?\" Colbert responded, shocked, before offering his own profane two-word response to the president.Colbert went on to discuss what he saw as the greatest fallacy of the president's reasons for banning transgender soldiers: increased medical costs.Though a 2016 study funded by the Pentagon found that military medical spending on transgender soldiers would increase anywhere from $2.4 million to $8.4 million, Colbert wanted to reframe those figures.\"To put that number in perspective, the military spends five times as much on Viagra,\" Colbert explained, \"And if your erection lasts for more than four hours, that’s too bad, because you’re stuck on a submarine for the next six months.\"On \"The Daily Show\" Trevor Noah had similar concerns about the president's cost-related excuse, pointing out that taxpayers are paying $60 million for Trump to travel to his various properties throughout his presidency.Noah also pondered which of Trump's generals  he'd consulted with, given that the Pentagon was unaware of his proclamation, suggesting that perhaps he'd spoken with The General Online.\"Late Night With Seth Meyers\" also invoked the cartoon general from the car insurance commercials, when Meyers opted to turn discussion of Trump's tweets over to four of his female writers. \"Today it might be trans people, but tomorrow it’s gay people, and then the next day it’s black people, and after that it’s women, and then it’s immigrants,\" the writers pointed out, all of those groups represented between them. On \"The Tonight Show\" Jimmy Fallon had the good sense to turn over a portion of his monologue to transgender comedian Patti Harrison, who had plenty to say about Trump's Wednesday announcement.\"When I saw the headline this morning, at first I just read, ‘Donald Trump bans transgender people,’ and I was like, ‘Yeah, that sounds like him,’” Harrison deadpanned. “But then I realized it was just in the military and I was shocked, because I assumed he already did that.\"But it was James Corden who took a completely different take on the transgender military ban, opting for a stylish and heartfelt song and dance, expressing his love and appreciation for the LGBT community.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:48:04.236Z","datePublished":"2017-07-27T17:03:00.000Z","headline":"Trump’s proposed transgender military ban turns late-night into hostile

TweetSet for release on Sept. 15, \"Give More Love\" will also feature cameos from Peter Frampton, Don Was, Richard Marx and Dave Stewart, among others. You can hear Starr's new track with Paul McCartney via Rolling Stone.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:01:04.209Z","datePublished":"2017-07-27T16:48:00.000Z","headline":"Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr are ‘on the road again’ in new song collaboration","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fd62c2a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/650x366+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcf%2Fa8%2F165f5719214ff1050e0f196debc4%2F650x366","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"August Brown"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#paul-mccartney-and-ringo-starr-are-on-the-road-again-in-new-song-collaboration"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Image QuoteFROM THE ARCHIVES: Patt Morrison Asks: Norman Lear, TV's seriously funny icon","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:47:22.619Z","datePublished":"2017-07-27T15:10:00.000Z","headline":"A Star Is Born: Norman Lear turns 95 today","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/25cd8bb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+45/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9c%2F4b%2F5585150473f34e56c02fd7635c5f%2Fimg-5975e19c-turbine-la-et-norman-lear-photo","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Los Angeles Times Staff"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#a-star-is-born-norman-lear-turns-95-today"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageLarry David revealed the real reason \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" is at last returning after a six-year hiatus: People wouldn't stop bugging him about it.The \"Seinfeld\" co-creator took the stage Wednesday at the Television Critics Assn. press tour in Beverly Hills -- joined by his \"Curb\" cohorts Susie Essman, Jeff Garlin and J.B. Smoove and executive producer Jeff Schaffer -- to discuss the show's coming ninth season. So, why bring back the show now after all these years?\"I'm not a misser,\" David told reporters. \"I don't really miss things, people that much, but I was missing it. I thought, yeah, what the hell. And I got tired of people asking me if the show was coming back. I couldn't get asked that question anymore and I wasn't ready to say, 'No, never.'\"The often madcap and sometimes hilariously perplexing 30-minute panel -- led by David's gruff wit and deadpans -- kicked off with a teaser for the season. There was David in a shower, David talking about constipation, David enduring the displeasure of middle-seat status on a flight.\"The amount of uncomfortable situations [real Larry David] has been in these last six years,\" Schaffer said, \"you're going to see it all. It's like we're sitting in the Ft. Knox of awkward.\"As for TV Larry David, Schaffer said viewers will learn very quickly what he's been up to during the years that have passed.\"Once the show starts to air, it will be self-evident,\" he said. \"It goes to this really strange, fun, crazy place.... And you will never expect where it ends.\"The trip to that ending begins Oct. 1 when the comedy returns to HBO. The 10-episode season brings back \"Curb\" favorites like Cheryl Hines, as well as frequent faces Richard Lewis, Bob Einstein, Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen.And what would a long-awaited return be without some guest stars? Elizabeth Banks, Ed Begley Jr., Carrie Brownstein, Bryan Cranston, Lauren Graham, Jimmy Kimmel, Nick Offerman, Nasim Pedrad and Elizabeth Perkins will get in on the fun.For those who still need something to pin their hopes on about what this season will entail, Garlin offered this absurdly brilliant comparison.\"It really thematically follows 'Pirates of the Caribbean.' ...

Weiss and David Benioff.  The series revolves around events that lead to the \"Third American Civil War\" and examines an alternate reality in which the South seceded from the Union and thus, slavery is still legal.Casey Bloys, president of HBO programming, defended the project Wednesday during the premium network's session at the summer edition of the Television Critics Assn. gathering at the Beverly Hilton.Bloys said that, in hindsight, the announcement was mishandled because it lacked the context and the vision that he received from Benioff and Weiss in discussing the series. He admitted it was \"misguided\" to believe they could simply announce a series with such a sensitive and volatile subject matter. \"We could have done a better job with the press release,\" he said. \"There was no benefit of context.\"\"My hope is people will judge the actual material instead of what it could be or should be or might be,\" he said. \"We'll rise or fall based on that material.\"He added that he felt the series, rather than being divisive, would be able to advance \"the racial discussion.\" Although the topic is controversial, he said he and the producers of the show \"all feel this is a risk worth taking.\"Bloys also stressed that the depiction of slavery would not echo \"Gone With the Wind\" and would not include whips and plantations.In other major HBO news, former \"Daily Show\" host Jon Stewart will perform a stand-up special at a date and time to be announced, and host the latest \"Night of Too Many Stars,\" an all-star benefit for autism.Also, a movie reboot of HBO's western \"Deadwood\" is closer to reality. Bloys said the show's creator, David Milch, has completed a script that will please fans of the series while also being accessible to those less familiar with the show. But, he said, reuniting the large cast, which included Timothy Olyphant and Ian McShane, may prove challenging.  ","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:51:09.085Z","datePublished":"2017-07-27T01:06:00.000Z","headline":"At TCA 2017, HBO defends ‘Confederate,’ announces Jon Stewart special and says ‘Deadwood’ movie is inching closer","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f713c3b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1022x575+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F36%2Fe1%2Ff420e6300aa225aa1678b7e3acea%2Fla-1501112873-i87fnkdgmf-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Greg Braxton"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#at-tca-2017-hbo-defends-confederate-announces-jon-stewart-special-and-says-deadwood-movie-is-inching-closer"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageJon Stewart will headline two stand-up specials for HBO.The news was announced Wednesday at the Television Critics Assn. press tour in Beverly Hills.The former \"Daily Show\" host will get a stand-up special — his first since since 1996's \"Jon Stewart: Unleavened\" aired on the network.   A date and location have not been confirmed.“We’re excited to bring Jon to the network with this pair of specials,” said HBO programming president Casey Bloys in a statement. “We’ve all missed his uniquely thoughtful brand of humor.”“I’m really thrilled to be able to return to stand-up on HBO,” added  Stewart in a statement. ”They’ve always set the standard for great stand-up specials.

I just can't do the other. It’s the same as I can’t make a casserole. I cannot sit still,\" she said in a sprawling new interview with Vanity Fair, in which she discussed her high-profile split from actor Brad Pitt.\"I've been trying for nine months to be really good at just being a homemaker and picking up dog poop and cleaning dishes and reading bedtime stories. And I'm getting better at all three. But now I need to get my boots on and go hang, take a trip,\" the humanitarian said of her plans to head to Africa for a mission with the preventing Sexual Violence Initiative. TweetThe Oscar-winning actress explained how and when her marriage devolved, though she didn't go into great detail about the breakup for the sake of their six kids.The marriage began suffering in the summer of 2016 while she was in post-production on her fifth directorial effort, \"First They Killed My Father,\" a film about Cambodia's Khmer Rouge genocide, which hits Netflix in September.\"Things got bad,\" Jolie said. \"I didn't want to use that word. ... Things became 'difficult.'\"The director became slightly defensive at the mention of the family's globe-trotting lifestyle, which reportedly had been grating on Pitt. \"[Our lifestyle] was not in any way a negative,\" she asserted. \"That was not the problem. That is and will remain one of the wonderful opportunities we are able to give our children. ...  They’re six very strong-minded, thoughtful, worldly individuals. I’m very proud of them.\"After 12 years together and a few years of marriage, Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt in September 2016. While her ex was couch-surfing, she and the kids spent nine months in a rental property before settling into a six-bedroom, 10-bathroom Los Feliz manse once owned by film legend Cecil B. DeMille.\"It's just been the hardest time, and we're just kind of coming up for air. [This house] is a big jump forward for us, and we're all trying to do our best to heal our family.\"The divorce filing came suddenly \"for the health of the family\" on the heels of a spat Pitt had with their 15-year-old son, Maddox. They reached a divorce settlement privately in January after battling publicly for months over custody of the kids. The Oscar-winning producer had been vilified with accusations of child abuse and having an affair with his \"Allied\" costar Marion Cotillard. But he arguably won over public opinion with his introspective GQ Style interview in May in which he admitted to sobering up after \"boozing too much.\"Last year, Jolie was diagnosed with hypertension and developed Bell's palsy when nerve damage caused one side of her face to droop. She took up acupuncture to treat it.“Sometimes women in families put themselves last,” she said, “until it manifests itself in their own health.”That's just the latest in her medical history. Following a preventative double mastectomy in 2013, she had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed in 2015, which sent her into menopause.\"I can’t tell if it’s menopause or if it’s just been the year I’ve had,\" she said, quipping about her dry skin and the idea that she could still be considered a sex symbol.\"I actually feel more of a woman because I feel like I'm being smart about my choices, and I'm putting my family first, and I'm in charge of my life and my health.

The 101-year-old is hoping that a judge will fast track the trial during her  Sept. 13 hearing date, which is just days before \"Feud\" is expected to be a big winner at the Primetime Emmy Awards. (The miniseries is nominated for 18 awards.)The \"Gone With the Wind\" star sued FX and \"Feud\" showrunner Ryan Murphy last month over her depiction in the miniseries about rival actresses Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. The two-time Oscar winner, who was played by actress Catherine Zeta-Jones on the show, makes legal claims about violations of her common law and statutory rights of publicity, her right to privacy and unjust enrichment. Image\"Based on her unusually advanced age, resulting particular susceptibility to disease, and recurring health issues, there is a substantial likelihood that she, as with anyone at this advanced age, may not survive for any extended period of time,\" the motion said. \"It is likely that if a trial preference motion is not granted, Olivia de Havilland will be prejudiced, because on the normal schedule, trial would not be set within the next 120 days.\"Her team also argued that because she is the sole plaintiff, De Havilland is crucial to the trial. \"Olivia de Havilland has a substantial interest in the litigation as a whole here as her personal statutory right of publicity cause of action does not survive her death. ... Further, should Olivia de Havilland die before her trial date, she will not be able to enjoy the benefits which she would receive in damages,\" the motion said.De Havilland's June 30 lawsuit said the show damaged her \"professional reputation for integrity, honesty, generosity, self-sacrifice and dignity.\" She claimed that FX, Murphy and Fox producers never sought or obtained her permission to be depicted in the series and that Zeta-Jones' portrayal of her in an episode about the 1963 Oscars cast her in a \"false, hurtful and damaging light.\" ImageThe defendants have not yet responded to de Havilland's initial filing. According to Deadline, the Paris-based actress will not be attending the September hearing but may return to Hollywood if the trial is expedited to November.Olivia

It was written under the assumption that Hillary Clinton would become president.“We did more rewriting than ever before because this election had happened and the world changed or solidified, in a way,” Glazer said.And with that came the decision to bleep out Trump’s name as if it were an expletive throughout the season.

Best female video and best male video have now been collapsed into artist of the year, and the network has also introduced a \"fight against the system\" award for videos that actively fight injustice.MTV, which announced the nominees with the help of Instagram influencers, has plenty of social media integration planned for the 2017 awards.Fans can vote online for nominees in eight VMA categories, and voting for best new artist will remain live through the VMA pre-show. During the pre-show, the two finalists will be announced and Twitter hashtag voting will commence, with the winner crowned during the telecast. Nominees for song of the summer, to be similarly voted on socially, will be announced at a later date.The 2017 MTV Video Music Awards will air from the Forum in Inglewood on Aug. 27 at 8 p.m. PDT.Here's the full list of nominees: ImageVIDEO OF THE YEAR Kendrick Lamar – “Humble”  Bruno Mars – “24K Magic”Alessia Cara – “Scars to Your Beautiful” DJ Khaled ft.

Perhaps no other American musician, save for departed Johnny Cash, has been so on brand as Pop has for nearly 50 years.It’s sort of freakish how intact and vital Pop remains at 70. Sure, time has taken its toll on the punk pioneer, from his bare torso’s crinkled skin to the limp that’s noticeable only when he’s not prowling the stage like the streetwalking cheetah with a heart full of napalm he saluted in “Search and Destroy.” Otherwise, not much has changed. ImageOpening with the sludgy riff of “I Wanna Be Your Dog,” his FYF set rumbled out of the speakers and sent festival-goers racing toward the stage. Iggy scorched the earth with a handful of classics from his arsenal of songs with the Stooges and from his solo catalog: “Gimme Danger,” “The Passenger,” “Lust for Life,” the latter of which remains rock’s ultimate life-affirming anthem.“I’m Sick of You,” a rarity from his “Raw Power” era with the Stooges, was a nice surprise, allowing Pop to channel the laconic crooner he has become in his twilight years.The only quibble? It’s too bad he didn’t showcase, aside from “Gardenia,” more material from “Post Pop Depression,” his excellent album last year with Queens of the Stone Age’s Josh Homme.That was a minor point in a blistering performance that proved age hasn’t blunted Pop’s force. Who else on the FYF lineup – from any year – could possibly return as a septuagenarian?

The piece had never been stretched onto a frame, the newspaper said.Gordon, the subject of Mike Myers' 2014 film \"Supermensch,\" said the piece was purchased by Cooper's late girlfriend Cindy Lang for $2,500 back in the 1970s. The rocker, who was good friends with the tinsel-haired pop artist, famously feigned his own execution in an identical electric chair during his macabre, high-spectacle concerts. Warhol supposedly caught one of those shows, the Guardian said.The theatrical rocker's piece is unsigned and unauthenticated, but Gordon took the small canvas to a Warhol expert who said the silkscreen is the real deal. (A green version of \"Little Electric Chair\" dated to 1964 sold for $11.6 million in 2015.)\"Truthfully, at the time no one thought it had any real value,” Gordon said. “Andy Warhol was not 'Andy Warhol' back then. And it was all a swirl of drugs and drinking. But you should have seen Alice’s face when [Warhol expert] Richard Polsky's estimate came in. His jaw dropped and he looked at me. 'Are you serious? I own that!'\"The image is believed to be based on a 1953 press photo of the Sing Sing prison death chamber where Ethel and Julius Rosenberg were executed for passing the secret of the atomic bomb to the Soviet Union. It is among a morbid series that also features car accidents, suicides and even tainted cans of tuna.Gordon began seeking out the red piece four years ago after an art dealer told him how much a Warhol had fetched at auction. Cooper's mother was the one who remembered that the piece had gone into storage after her son declined to hang it in his home. Apparently he didn't want something of such value to be in the house, the newspaper said.However, Gordon said Cooper appears to have changed his mind.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:52:36.846Z","datePublished":"2017-07-24T20:32:00.000Z","headline":"Alice Cooper discovers forgotten Andy Warhol masterpiece rolled up in storage locker","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/12a16b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe8%2Fec%2F9c216be2f6d57a12ff2db65fd6f6%2Flat-et-alicecooper-la0036625836-20170724","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Nardine Saad"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#alice-cooper-discovers-forgotten-andy-warhol-masterpiece-rolled-up-in-storage-locker"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe underpaid women of the BBC have spoken, and it seems the network is listening.On Sunday, 45 exasperated female television presenters from the BBC wrote a letter to the public broadcaster demanding that it close its gender pay gap. Immediately. (Not three years from now, as BBC management had originally proposed.)The memorandum followed last week's release of the BBC's salary report, which revealed that male BBC television and radio personalities earn significantly more than their female counterparts — even those who perform essentially the same job function. The BBC responded with a 2020 target date to implement an equal pay standard. But Claire Balding — one of the BBC's high-profile sports presenters and a leading voice in Sunday's directive — thought the network could step up its efforts. TweetIn a letter penned in response to the female presenters, BBC director Tony Hall agreed, saying that the U.K. network must address the salary rift with haste. “I have committed the BBC to closing the gap by 2020 and if we can get there earlier then we will,” he wrote. “We are not, however, making a standing start. Work is already well underway across the organization to help achieve this. There will be wider consultation meetings over the next two months so we can accelerate further change in the autumn.”Hall reiterated that he feels \"confident\" the salary figures will \"look very different\" when they're published again next year, adding that closing the gap has been \"a personal priority over the last four years.\"But, evidently, there's still quite a bit of work ahead.\"When other organizations publish their gender pay data by next April,\" Hall's letter read, \"I want the BBC to be one of the best performers when comparisons are made.\"\"But beyond that,\" he continued, \"over the next three years I want the BBC to be regarded as an exemplar on gender and diversity.\"","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:02:51.250Z","datePublished":"2017-07-24T19:47:00.000Z","headline":"BBC director hopes to close the broadcaster’s gender pay gap before 2020","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/52a917c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+12/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1e%2Fb1%2F63ba16686002f121b30836dfcebb%2Fimg-597644e4-turbine-la-bbc-20170724","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Emily Mae Czachor"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#bbc-director-hopes-to-close-the-broadcasters-gender-pay-gap-before-2020"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageMaxwell is headed to the Hollywood Bowl. The elusive soul crooner announced he’s returning to the Bowl for the first time in eight years on Oct. 8.

She entered the crowd to sing an entire verse with a black female fan, further speaking to the album’s aim to connect directly to the black experience. “A Seat at the Table” was the first time many heard her outside of the shadow of her mega-star sister Beyoncé. It's understandable, but a shame considering she’s been putting out eclectic records since she was a teen. She touched on some of her early work during Sunday's show.  She riffed on the “Proud Family” theme she wrote at 15 (it featured her sister’s group, Destiny’s Child) to the delight of her most ardent fans and offered a more stripped-down, almost sensuous take of “T.O.N.Y.” from her eclectic “Sol-Angel and the Hadley Street Dreams.”It was remarkable seeing the showwoman she's become, masterfully leading the band through a myriad of sonic breakdowns and improvising with her vocalists.“I feel so much gratitude that I’ve been able to evolve and experiment,” she acknowledged before diving into \"Losing You,\" the sticky dance-R&B gem that served as her breakout single.MORE from FYF:How Frank Ocean — and Brad Pitt — made FYF Fest feel one of a kindBjork shows the humanity in machinery at FYF FestAfter a long absence, Missy Elliott returns — and turns FYF Fest into a dance partyIn impressive 3-D set, Flying Lotus breaks the fourth wall at FYF FestFrom serene to savage, Angel Olsen goes in for the kill at Friday's FYF Fest","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:48:04.854Z","datePublished":"2017-07-24T19:06:00.000Z","headline":"Solange brings healing to FYF Fest with jubilant celebration of black joy","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/511faed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F14%2Fa3%2F63f91c786e6512d756f558f76fbf%2Fla-et-ms-fyf-20170724","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Gerrick Kennedy"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#solange-brings-healing-to-fyf-fest-with-jubilant-celebration-of-black-joy"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer's tumultuous high school years get a close-up in the first teaser for \"My Friend Dahmer,\" which was released over the weekend.\"I'm just like anybody else,\" says Dahmer, played by Disney Channel alum Ross Lynch, in the teaser.The biopic, which played at the Tribeca and Los Angeles film festivals earlier this year, chronicles Dahmer's early days leading-up to his killing rampage of 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991.\"This is the story before that story,\" reads the trailer's log line.Lynch plays severely against type as the 17-year-old Dahmer during a time when the alienated teen dissolved roadkill in acid and talked of his fascination with bones.

It also reminded Bennington and readers that he was the best husband to his wife, Talinda, and father to their son.\"The family will never be whole without you,\" the letter said.The most poignant part of the note came when the band recalled Bennington's dynamic personality and how his inner struggles brought a humanity to his music. Bennington's excitement about their years to come was infectious, the band said, and his absence \"leaves a void that can never be filled — a boisterous, funny, ambitious, creative, kind, generous voice in the room is missing.\" QuoteHowever, the Grammy-winning act seemed determined to carry on, noting that its love for making and performing music \"is inextinguishable.\"\"While we don’t know what path our future may take, we know that each of our lives was made better by you.

For a few, that even meant sneaking off to a late-night warehouse for one more round. As the sun went down over the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the producers Avalon Emerson and Daniel Avery brought mercurial, alien moods to the Woods stage. Each can fit neatly into a traditional techno environment, but they're album artists at heart, and think hard about how long sets can find a plot line.Around the corner at the Outer Space, a triple-team of DJ Harvey, Horse Meat Disco and Young Marco had brighter, major-key vibes on their decks, and played off each other's sensibilities.Coupled with Nicolas Jaar's sous-vide approach to live club music (a very slow boil, perfect execution, a mighty payoff at the end) on the Trees stage outside, FYF's growing adeptness with edgy dance music could be a promising direction going forward, maybe even part of a push to transform more of the city's nightlife. Frank Ocean was the story of the night, to be sure. But as the day's margaritas turned into night's strobe-lit abandon, some fans weren't quite ready to go home.At a Skid Row warehouse very early on Sunday morning, Emerson and Young Marco played another sort-of-sanctioned late-night gig. It was packed and smoky and maybe a little overwhelming after a long day, but watching their music transition from Goldenvoice-approved professionalism back into downtown grit was like going back in time to when FYF felt a little on edge.It was a very fond memory. MORE from FYF:Bjork shows the humanity in machinery at FYF FestAfter a long absence, Missy Elliott returns — and turns FYF Fest into a dance partyIn impressive 3-D set, Flying Lotus breaks the fourth wall at FYF FestFrom serene to savage, Angel Olsen goes in for the kill at Friday's FYF Fest","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:55:49.870Z","datePublished":"2017-07-23T20:32:00.000Z","headline":"Techno takes the late shift at FYF","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6004043/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4a%2F74%2Fe12da964c2a0e83b1ffecb071734%2Fla-1500841661-0iaumr25ox-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"August Brown"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#techno-takes-the-late-shift-at-fyf"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageMike Hadreas knows how to make an entrance. A grand one. The artist, who performs as Perfume Genius, slinked onstage at FYF Fest Saturday night to the twinkling piano notes of “Otherside,” the opening track from his new album, “No Shape.”He sang each note with quiet precision until the song suddenly cracked wide open in a kaleidoscope of swirling rhythms. With stage lights pulsing blues and yellows, Hadreas struck pose after pose, head lifted to the heavens and microphone cord dangling as if he were Kylie Minogue on the album cover of “Fever.” (That’s high praise.)“I’m all revved up,” Hadreas said at one point, instructing his two-piece band to launch into the next song.Long gone are the days of Hadreas shrinking onstage, shyly emoting with a quiver and awkward stage banter. At FYF, he was a monster, by turns delicate and visceral as he crouched and swiveled his hips in slow motion.His voice, a tremulous tenor, pierced the songs with shrieks (a jarring reimagining of Mary Margaret O’Hara’s “Body’s in Trouble”), coos (the Sade-evoking “Die 4 You”) and crescendos that drifted into the stratosphere (“Fool” from 2014’s “Too Bright”).  Blake Mills, the ace guitarist and songwriter who produced “No Shape,” joined in on a handful of songs, and Weyes Blood’s Natalie Mering reprised her duet with Hadreas, “Sides,” from his new album.Ending the performance with “Slip Away,” Hadreas went out the way he came in: with arms outstretched in an ecstatic pose, a mirror reflection of his enraptured audience.MORE from FYF:Bjork shows the humanity in machinery at FYF FestAfter a long absence, Missy Elliott returns — and turns FYF Fest into a dance party In impressive 3-D set, Flying Lotus breaks the fourth wall at FYF FestFrom serene to savage, Angel Olsen goes in for the kill at Friday's FYF Fest","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:58:49.762Z","datePublished":"2017-07-23T18:30:00.000Z","headline":"A mighty Perfume Genius veers from delicate to visceral at FYF","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e35f017/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fae%2Fd0%2Fabdffd23a682f8bb9f9357528670%2Fla-1500834437-rggxtijc0n-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"James Reed"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#a-mighty-perfume-genius-veers-from-delicate-to-visceral-at-fyf"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Image QuoteFROM THE ARCHIVES: Daniel Radcliffe hopes the magic is gone and he'll be taken seriously   ","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:57:12.826Z","datePublished":"2017-07-23T15:00:00.000Z","headline":"A Star Is Born: Daniel Radcliffe turns 28 today","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fee681e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x576+0+76/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdd%2Ff5%2F16482fddeef394e737b47749ee75%2Fimg-59727c5f-turbine-la-daniel-radcliffe-2012-20170721","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Los Angeles Times Staff"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#a-star-is-born-daniel-radcliffe-turns-28-today"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageFrank Ocean’s long-awaited return to a local stage is over. Anchoring the second night of FYF Fest, Ocean performed for the first time in the States since the summer of 2014.   Opening with an extended take on his single \"Solo,\" Ocean’s set began with a lengthy overture and the singer asking for the audience to be patient with him as he caught his groove.\"I'm just finding my moment, y'all are gonna have to wait a minute,\" he said after slowly emerging via a catwalk that extended to a secondary stage deep into the Exposition Park crowd a little over 10 minutes after his set was to start .  During his three-year absence, the anticipation for his comeback turned into frustration -- so much so fans wondered if Ocean would even show for Saturday night's engagement.In 2015 he was booked for a headlining slot at FYF, inciting rumors that the follow-up to his Grammy-winning 2012 major label debut, “Channel Orange,” was imminent.It was buzz he had created earlier that year when he took to his Tumblr to post a picture of himself looking down at a stack of magazines called Boys Don’t Cry. His reps confirmed the arrival of a new album and an accompanying publication.  But days before the 2015 festival, he pulled out, leaving organizers to turn to Kanye West as an eleventh-hour replacement.  In summer 2016, after years of whispers, Ocean returned with not one but two projects: visual album “Endless” and his official album “Blonde,” but both records were almost overshadowed by label drama and his lack of conventional promotion.Fans, understandably, were on edge leading into Saturday’s performance.Even recently, Ocean has proven to be unpredictable. The experimental R&B singer had earlier this year pulled out of Alabama's Hangout Music Festival and Washington's Sasquatch! Music Festival.As Ocean was running a few minutes behind, a male fan was heard wondering, \"Is he even gonna show?\"But he did, and even early in his set he proved to be unconventional. Near the beginning of his performance, during a rendition of \"Good Guy,\" Ocean halted the show. \"This is my disclaimer,\" he said. \"This is my fourth show since coming back. We are gonna try things over if they get (messed) up and this is one of those instances.\" ","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:52:25.936Z","datePublished":"2017-07-23T07:35:00.000Z","headline":"Frank Ocean resurfaces in the U.S. at FYF Fest","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c415b02/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1022x575+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F99%2F7f%2Faec6620cd67776c86eadeafe9099%2Fla-1500824281-swq0lm07ih-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Gerrick Kennedy"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#frank-ocean-resurfaces-in-the-u-s-at-fyf-fest"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageFYF Fest's past and future had a quick changeover in the venue's Club tent on Saturday afternoon at Exposition Park.First, the future.New York rapper Princess Nokia soaked up every ounce of her packed crowd's adulation, noting how exceptional it is for a young woman rapping about being a \"normal teenager\" to end up on a stage like this. Her talent, however, is far beyond normal.On songs such as \"Bart Simpson\" and \"Green Line,\" she commanded the stage and rapped with a lucid, urgent vision. She's at the vanguard of a young-millennial music world where intersectionality pairs well with bass-rattling bangers, and when coupled with her undeniable charisma and the imagination of her productions, it was easy to imagine her moving up the ranks at this fest very quickly.Her set-closer, a tenderly-sung jungle tune called \"Dragons,\" recalled \"Bombs Over Baghdad\" in its drum patterns, but the searching melody was all Nokia's. \"My Moon, my life / My stars, my sun / You are the sweetest song,\" she sang. It'll likely take her beyond what most normal teenagers would ever dream.Cap'n Jazz, however, saw a turnover from young women in crop-tops and semi-ironic raver pants into gently-aging dudes in Converge and Hot Water Music T-shirts.Cap'n Jazz too, was the product of teenage minds, albeit young punks in college-town Illinois in the early '90s. But the Kinsella brothers' reunited emo act was one of the weekend's few nods back to the old guard of FYF Fest, when ear gauges and lip rings were everywhere.Singer Tim Kinsella crowd-surfed, haphazardly honked a French horn, took his shirt off for effect, and led the crowd in a reverie of punky adolescent noise.The band knew this set was a throwback. \"We wrote this song in 1994, so it's our newest one,\" Kinsella riffed. Were the actual kids today into it?

And FYF, which the band first played in 2014, proved that the five-piece, even after all these years, has neither a speck of age nor an ounce of fat on it.“More reverb!” someone called out early on, perhaps a cheeky acknowledgment that the band was already drowning in gauzy effects.“More reverb? Is there ever enough?” Goswell shot back.Well, in this case, yes. Her ghostly vocals, along with those of powerhouse guitarist Neil Halstead, often evaporated before they ever made an impression. Mystique has always been part of the band’s allure, but at FYF, the sound mix should have been much sharper.Otherwise, Slowdive was in peak form, interspersing new tracks (“Slomo,” “Star Roving”) with classics (“Catch the Breeze,” “When the Sun Hits”) that rippled over a swaying sea of fans with eyes shut and heads bobbing.

Put it down for one record,” Elliott ordered.Already by this point Elliott had literally danced herself out of one of her shoes, and her in-ear monitors had forsaken her, but she came with a mission for her first full-length performance in the U.S. in about a decade: “To make sure everybody in the building jump[s].”She was introducing “Get Ur Freak On,” one of the litany of era-defining entries in her lengthy catalog of wildly imaginative hits anchored in sticky hooks and exuberant beats. All of them always came paired with a quirky, left-of-center video (if you remember this particular clip, it was the one in which she dangled from a chandelier).She wanted the crowd at Exposition Park completely lost in the music — the way we are in the car or the club or the gym. And she commanded her DJ to repeat the song's famous opening line — \"Head banga, hit me\" — to make her point. And that’s how she spent much of Friday’s set, relentlessly hitting an audience over the head with song after song. It helped that she had attracted a massive crowd that came ready to dance early into Saturday morning.Elliott tore through a dizzying selection of her slickest work — cocky anthem “She’s A Bitch,” saucy romp “One Minute Man” and the frenetic “I’m Really Hot” — while making time for deep cuts, rarely performed entries and fan favorites in her hourlong set.Dressed in ripped, white jeans and a white jacket adorned with seemingly thousands of crystals, Elliott wasn’t about festival frills — there were no special guests and no trippy production during her set.Still, she did arrive and depart via a box outlined in pink neon — a magical time capsule, perhaps? Or maybe a teleportation device? Nevertheless, it only added to her mysterious and reclusive nature, especially when the show ended and an Elliott marionette was left in her absence. Backed throughout by a cadre of dancers, Elliott tackled an impressive assortment of her 20-year deep catalog in the night’s most attended set. Beyoncé, Solange, Katy Perry, Janet Jackson, Bjork and Tyler the Creator were some of Elliott’s famous fans spotted in the crowd.Nearly a dozen years have passed since Elliott last released an album, but this wasn’t a nostalgia play. Music this otherworldly and imaginative doesn't belong to any particular era.\"The music we created was so ahead, it couldn't be dated,\" she waxed in a video interlude that traced her achievements. Indeed, “Pass That Dutch” is as potent a dance anthem in 2017 as it was 14 years ago, “Hot Boyz” and “All in My Grill” pairs nicely with the bass rattling, trap R&B being spun now and the futuristic bounce of her breakout single, “The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly),” still sticks — all of which the crowd chanted in unison without missing a beat.And despite Elliott's orders, many tried to balance cellphone snaps with feverish dancing. MORE from FYF:Bjork shows the humanity in machinery at FYF FestIn impressive 3-D set, Flying Lotus breaks the fourth wall at FYF FestFrom serene to savage, Angel Olsen goes in for the kill at Friday's FYF Fest FYF Fest day-by-day guide: The 15 must-see acts","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:47:19.996Z","datePublished":"2017-07-22T20:59:00.000Z","headline":"After a long absence, Missy Elliott returns — and turns FYF Fest into a dance party","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a9840a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F05%2F2b%2F6538d2df390dbb41d69c2a87ba03%2Fla-et-ms-missy-20170722","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Gerrick Kennedy"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#after-a-long-absence-missy-elliott-returns-and-turns-fyf-fest-into-a-dance-party"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageAngel Olsen’s voice — with its bewitching sweep one minute and jagged edges the next — was tailor-made for a festival setting. It’s the kind of instrument that fills the air and lures in even those who have no idea who she is.At sundown Friday, FYF Fest's opening day, the North Carolina-based singer-songwriter was holding court with an intense set that answered the never-asked question, “What would happen if Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris had brought PJ Harvey instead of Linda Ronstadt into that fabled trio?”Since surfacing with 2012’s “Half Way Home,” Olsen has evolved into an arresting live performer, slippery with her notes and occasionally aloof in her banter but blunt in how she relays the emotion of her songs.At FYF, her five-piece band, sharp in their matching charcoal suits and Western ties, built a wall of clanging sounds behind her. In particular, Heather McEntire on harmonies and keys (and on loan from the band Mount Moriah) locked into a trance with Olsen, the wailing Phil to Olsen’s Don Everly.And yet Olsen cut right through the cacophony, commanding her bandmates as they transitioned from the onslaught of “Not Gonna Kill You” (from last year’s acclaimed “My Woman”) into the slow burn of “Acrobat.” They stripped that early fan favorite of its … well, its vocal acrobatics, instead turning it into an incantation.Olsen capped her hourlong performance with “Woman,” another new song, sending the audience into the night with a final challenge: “I dare you to understand / What makes me a woman.”MORE from FYF:Bjork shows the humanity in machinery at FYF FestIn impressive 3-D set, Flying Lotus breaks the fourth wall at FYF FestFYF Fest day-by-day guide: The 15 must-see acts ","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:49:44.965Z","datePublished":"2017-07-22T19:37:00.000Z","headline":"From serene to savage, Angel Olsen goes in for the kill at Friday’s FYF Fest","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0eb023e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2046x1151+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F24%2F14%2F1fea41ae6432d5a56d5bcf5a5f5c%2Fla-1500751109-1dogs00lng-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"James Reed"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#from-serene-to-savage-angel-olsen-goes-in-for-the-kill-at-fridays-fyf-fest"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageIt would be hard for Flying Lotus to make anything as terrifyingly visceral on a stage as he did in his movie \"Kuso.\" That film almost defies description in its litany of body horrors. But he did his best to reach out and mangle audience's minds during his night-closing set at FYF Fest on Friday.When FYF-goers opened their ticket packages, a pair of FlyLo-branded 3-D goggles suggested that the Los Angeles-based producer had something big in store. For an artist whose musical work is always inseparable from his visual identity, this was a natural next step. But the show was a testament to his increasing ambitions as an all-around artist -- and the ambitions of FYF Fest to push its talent to create bigger, bolder sets.With the glasses on, the audience saw laser fans sweeping out overhead like a false ceiling. Sleek digital objects popped out of nowhere to tower over his gear rig. Fields of stars blossomed behind him, making it look like Lotus was performing before infinite depths. The music was dancier and clubbier than usual, as if he knew that the retina-bending setup required some kick-drum grounding. But L.A. is lucky to have an artist who never ceases to push his talents into strange new realms like this.Meanwhile, a little earlier, Anderson .Paak gave FYF fans whiplash, as anyone who walked by his set had no choice but to watch, gape-jawed, as his played Sheila E.-worthy drums while rapping, singing, bandleading and utterly commanding his stage. His is a once-in-a-generation talent, and after years of struggle he's finally playing the kinds of stages where he belongs.Lotus' pal Hannibal Buress played the night's lone big-stage comedy set, and it was just as giddily unnerving. He talked through a Bon Iver-style vocal harmonizer, lamented that he didn't have a trademark terminal disease of his own (\"Alzheimer's, Hodgkins', Buress' disease.\") and imagined the gory details of his own funeral.

Gone, for instance, were the multi-hour waits to reach the Exposition Park grounds. What's more, the sounds of a saxophone player sheepishly moving through a cover of Drake's \"Passionfruit\" set the tone for a relatively chill first few hours at FYF.Inside, many sought refuge as the sun stung most of the festival's acreage — for many that meant lounging under trees or taking selfies in front of art installations such as a giant replica of a boombox.At the Lawn Stage, Beach Fossils delivered a peppy set, and elsewhere, the freewheeling hip-hop-inflected jazz of BadBadNotGood enraptured what was the largest crowd we noticed early into the day.People danced under trees and stretched out on blankets as the tail end of magic hour brought a much-needed breeze.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:01:23.943Z","datePublished":"2017-07-22T04:40:00.000Z","headline":"No early headaches as a newly expanded FYF Fest begins","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/52d91d5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F0f%2F9ad549477b6ce6cbbecaaafc31f3%2Fla-1500697317-xf1p9ba9hj-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Gerrick Kennedy"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#no-early-headaches-as-a-newly-expanded-fyf-fest-begins"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"HBO is developing a modern-day slavery drama with a sci-fi spin -- and the Internet is not having it.The new show, titled \"Confederate,\" will be helmed by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss -- the famed showrunner duo behind \"Game of Thrones,\" both of whom are white men.Gearing up for what HBO's Wednesday announcement called the Third American Civil War, \"Confederate\" takes place in a grisly dystopia wherein America's Southern states successfully seceded from the union, \"giving rise to a nation in which slavery remains legal and has evolved into a modern institution.\"The announcement received loads of immediate backlash from fans and critics alike, many of whom recognized the potentially pernicious irony of two white men creating a television series about slavery. (Benioff and Weiss are no strangers to this sort of pushback; the team has been criticized in the past for the lack of diversity on \"GoT.\")“Give me the confidence of white showrunners telling HBO they wanna write slavery fanfic,” tweeted journalist Pilot Viruet. Author Roxane Gay felt similarly exasperated, writing, “It is exhausting to think of how many people at HBO said yes to letting two white men envision modern day slavery. And offensive.\" Tweet Tweet TweetAs for the inspiration behind \"Confederate,\" Benioff said he had always wondered what might have become of America had the South won the Civil War. \"That just always fascinated me,\" he said. Benioff and Weiss -- as well as their creative partners, the husband-and-wife team of writer-producers Malcolm Spellman and Nichelle Tramble Spellman -- spoke with Vulture to explain themselves. The negative reaction, they said, was exactly what they had expected.\"Oh, yeah. We all knew it was coming in one form or another,\" said Benioff. \"I remember the very first time we talked about this, one of the first things that came up was … Malcolm said, what was it?\"“You’re dealing with weapons-grade material here,\" Spellman chimed in. And perhaps that's why the Spellmans' involvement is so crucial. Though their presence on the show's creative team might have been partially eclipsed by the arguably more famous Benioff and Weiss, their partnership is quite notable. The Spellmans, who are black, have firmly expressed their intentions to avoid the typical exploitative, damaging slave narrative. Malcolm Spellman took to Twitter earlier this week, assuring concerned critics that \"Confederate\" will not be about \"whips and plantations.\" Instead, he told Vulture, they'll focus on the fact that the show is rooted in science fiction.\"I think what was interesting to all of us was that we were going to handle this show, and handle the content of the show, without using typical antebellum imagery,\" Tramble Spellman said. \"This is present day, or close to present day, and how the world would have evolved if the South had been successful seceding from the union.\"Malcolm Spellman echoed his wife's point:\"[W]hat people have to understand is, and what we are obligated to repeat in every interview is: We've got black aunties. We've got black nephews, uncles. Black parents and black grandparents. We deal with them every single day. We deal with the struggle every single day. And people don't have to get on board with what we're doing based on a press release.\"But when they're writing about us, and commenting about us, they should be mindful of the fact that there are no sellouts involved in this show,\" he added. \"Me and Nichelle are not props being used to protect someone else. We are people who feel a need to address issues the same way they do, and they should at least humanize the other end of those tweets and articles.\"","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:51:29.257Z","datePublished":"2017-07-21T19:40:00.000Z","headline":"Responding to backlash, producers of HBO’s ‘Confederate’ promise it’s not a typical slavery story","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Emily Mae Czachor"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#responding-to-backlash-producers-of-hbos-confederate-promise-its-not-a-typical-slavery-story"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageWhen Maria Menounos' doctor told her she had a brain tumor, the former E!

When a promotional poster first appeared earlier this month it raised more than a few eyebrows for more than a few reasons. A drama about the collapse of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, starring Charlie Sheen?A Japanese trailer for the movie has now appeared online, providing the first glimpses of the movie. Directed and co-written by Martin Guigui, the movie is based on Patrick Carson’s fact-based play “Elevator” and also stars Whoopi Goldberg, Gina Gershon, Luiz Guzman, Wood Harris and Jacqueline Bisset.In the trailer, Sheen and Gershon are a married couple on the brink of divorce. They are in an elevator at the WTC when the towers are attacked and find themselves stuck with three strangers. As they figure out what is really happening, they attempt to escape. At one point, after seeming to have already helped Gershon out of the elevator car, Sheen says, “The building is coming down.”Aside from the fact that seeing troubled star Sheen in any movie at all is notable at this point, his appearance in a movie specifically about 9/11 is of particular interest.

With the Shakur biopic \"All Eyez on Me\" now in theaters, she's been on fire about the movie's \"reimagining\" of their relationship, last month calling it \"very hurtful.\" The actress, who is married to Will Smith, told Sway it was \"kind of hard\" to describe her relationship with the fallen rapper \"because I haven't really told the whole story.\"The drug-dealer angle, being \"in the life,\" is something she hasn't shared before. Something \"very bad\" happened to her around that time, and she got out, she said. \"I've been having kind of an existential crisis around Pac because I was coming out, he was coming in, and there was a point at which we met. And then we kinda were going our separate ways. And I just felt like, 'OK, God, one day you're going to do for Pac what you did for me, which is, you saved me.' And that just never happened for him.\"Shakur was fatally shot in a 1996 drive-by in Las Vegas. \"Pac and I's relationship was about survival,\" Pinkett Smith said. \"That's how it started. And I know most people want to always connect it in this romance thing, and that's just because they don't have the story.\"She said the drug-dealer detail was important to share, finally, because it gives insight to who they were together. \"It wasn't just about, oh, you have this cute girl, and this cool guy, they must have been in this — nah, it wasn't that at all. It was about survival, and it had always been about survival between us.\" But that's it, for now, despite how upset she's been about \"Eyez.\" \"It's not for me to try to protect his legacy, and ... whatever Pac's fate has been around his life, around his story, around his legacy, God's got it, and I just got to really lay down my feelings and trust that God's got it.\" Something God doesn't have, but that Pinkett Smith is seeing progress around, is diversity in Hollywood, which she took a notable stand on when she boycotted the Oscars in 2016. That was the year her husband, Will Smith, was not nominated for his work in \"Concussion\" and the #OscarsSoWhite campaign took hold.

She's also privy to the ways in which powerful men manage to dodge accountability when they're caught fooling around.So when a high-profile male celebrity such as Jay-Z opens up about his marital transgressions, Lewinsky is clearly the person to weigh in.In a new op-ed piece titled \"Jay-Z, Prince Harry, Brad Pitt, and the New Frontiers of Male Vulnerability,\" which the former White House intern penned for Vanity Fair, she lauded the rapper and mogul for his honesty when addressing his past infidelities on his new album, \"4:44.\" He didn't have to be quite so candid, she said.\"Jay-Z had a choice,\" Lewinsky wrote. \"Having been called out publicly by his wife in her fierce 2016 album and video, 'Lemonade,' Jay-Z knew that his fans wouldn’t have blinked if his next album skimmed past the allegations. That’s not uncommon for men to do.\"And it’s not as if we hadn’t seen Beyoncé and Jay-Z out in the world together since then — not to mention, welcoming their twins to planet Earth. Jay-Z could have ignored it all. But, instead, he chose a path of candor that will move the conversation forward and help others.\"Jay-Z's \"4:44\" is probably best described as acutely personal. In \"Footnotes for 4:44,\" he exposed the intimate details of his once-tenuous marriage.“This is my real life,\" he said in the video. \"I just ran into this place and we built this big, beautiful mansion of a relationship that wasn’t totally built on the 100% truth and it starts cracking. Things start happening that the public can see. Then we had to get to a point of ‘OK, tear this down and let’s start from the beginning’ ...

Not an army of White Walkers, but rather a Third American Civil War (and, we presume, an explanation of how the second one went down). \"We are thrilled to be able to continue our relationship with Dan and David, knowing that any subject they take on will result in a unique and ambitious series,” HBO Programming President Casey Bloys said in a statement.“Their intelligent, wry and visually stunning approach to storytelling has a way of engaging an audience and taking them on an unforgettable journey.

And radio host Chris Evans, the broadcast network's chief earner, takes home more than $2.9 million -- about 20 times the salary of the U.K. prime minister. The BBC's payroll docket is a sensitive issue, which is why the network has kept its contents under wraps until now. In the U.K., there is a $190 annual fee exacted on every television-owning household, as well as those who watch BBC programs online. That means that multimillionaire stars, like Evans, are essentially profiting from BBC-consuming taxpayer bills. ImageThe salaries, which were published in ranked clusters rather than specific figures, reveal a stark wage gap along gender and race lines. Two-thirds of the BBC's highest earners are men. Its top-earning woman -- \"Strictly Come Dancing\" host Claudia Winkleman -- makes less than a quarter of Evans' salary. This is an apparent pattern throughout the report, which revealed stark wage rifts between male and female personalities who basically fulfill the same job function.The report also raised issues about race, as the BBC's elite band of earners are overwhelmingly white in addition to overwhelmingly male. None of its nonwhite stars earn more than about $391,000 a year. While BBC chief Tony Hall conceded that the report did expose \"the need to go further and faster on issues of gender and diversity,\" he defended the astronomical salaries.“The BBC does not exist in a market on its own where it can set the market rates,” he said in a speech to his staff on Tuesday. “If we are to give the public what they want, then we have to pay for those great presenters and stars.\"","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:00:49.806Z","datePublished":"2017-07-19T18:54:00.000Z","headline":"Who earns the most at the BBC?

That's what the police report said, but the alignment was off on my car, so I went to AutoZone to see if I could do anything about it,\" Carter said. Although a motorcyclist reported that Carter was \"swerving all over the road,\" the singer vowed that the issue was a problem with the tire's alignment -- and nothing more. Because, he reiterated, \"I do not drink alcohol at all.\" Or, rather, he doesn't drink hard liquor at all? \"I’ll occasionally have a sip of beer or something like that, but I can’t even drink IPAs,” he clarified. \"I can't drink anything like that. I have to drink the lightest beer possible that's not hoppy. I don't drink any hard liquor.\"As for the marijuana charges, Carter told \"ET\" that he obtains the drug legally and uses it only to treat his anxiety, chronic pain and suppressed appetite.

Apparently, Madonna had no idea the items weren't in her possession anymore. \"The fact that I have attained celebrity status as a result of success in my career does not obviate my right to maintain my privacy, including with regard to highly personal items,\" Madonna said in court papers obtained by the Associated Press. \"I understand that my DNA could be extracted from a piece of my hair. It is outrageous and grossly offensive that my DNA could be auctioned for sale to the general public.\"According to the New York Daily News, which first reported the development, the items up for sale came from Darlene Lutz, a former friend who helped Madonna pack up her Miami home, and also included a letter in which the Material Girl snarked on Whitney Houston and Sharon Stone. \"Maybe this is what black people felt like when Elvis Presley got huge,” she wrote in the letter, according to the auction site, as reported by the Daily News. \"It's so unequivocally frustrating to read that Whitney Houston has the music career I wish I had and Sharon Stone has the film career I’ll never have. Not because I want to be these women because I’d rather die but they’re so horribly mediocre.\"Shakur and Madonna dated for a while starting in 1993, she confirmed in 2015. In his letter to her, which the collectibles auction house expected to sell for $400,000, he apologized for previous behavior. \"Please,\" he wrote, \"understand my previous position as that of a young man with limited experience with a extremely famous sex symbol.\"In the same letter, Shakur talked about how it wouldn't hurt her career — and would likely enhance it — if she were seen with a black man. But for him, because of his \"image,\" he felt that being seen with her would be \"letting down half of the people who made me what I thought I was.\"The \"Hit Em Up\" rapper started serving a prison sentence for sexual assault a month after writing the letter and was released in October 1995. He was fatally shot on Sept. 13, 1996, at age 25 in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas. The \"Borderline\" singer was 38 at the time of his death. The judge's ruling Tuesday is not final. \"Madonna’s allegations will be vigorously challenged and refuted in a court of law in due course,\" a spokesman for the auction house and Lutz told the New York Post. \"We are confident that the Madonna memorabilia will be back.\"The balance of the 120 items in the auction are currently up for bid.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:48:18.602Z","datePublished":"2017-07-19T17:05:00.000Z","headline":"Madonna blocks auction of Tupac Shakur letter, ‘personally worn’ panties","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Christie D’Zurilla"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#madonna-blocks-auction-of-tupac-shakur-letter-personally-worn-panties"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Image​Just six months after its release, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's summer hit \"Despacito\" has become the most-streamed song ever, logging 4.6 billion streams to date.That figure  includes streams of the Fonsi-Yankee track as well as a remix featuring Justin Bieber.In taking over the top spot, the Spanish-language \"Despacito\" (which translates to \"slowly\"), surpasses the previous record holder, Bieber's \"Sorry,\" which has tallied 4.38 billion streams for the original song and associated remixes.“Luis Fonsi already had the undisputed, biggest song of the year – and now he’s setting even bigger records,\" Universal Music Group Chairman and Chief Executive Lucian Grainge said in a statement. \"Streaming has opened up the possibility of a song with a different beat, from a different culture and in a different language to become a juggernaut of success around the world.\"Another Universal executive, Jesus Lopez, chairman and CEO of Universal Music Latin America & Iberian Peninsula, added, \"Streaming has democratized music consumption, it has made Latin music increasingly relevant on the charts and it has amplified our songs and videos to a world stage.”The official video for \"Despacito\" now shows 2.66 billion views on YouTube.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:48:33.245Z","datePublished":"2017-07-19T16:50:00.000Z","headline":"Nothing slow about it: ‘Despacito’ is now the most-streamed song ever","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/903448f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/580x326+0+37/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcd%2F7f%2F9d262b28ccfc49dd8f0c44eaee7c%2Fla-et-ms-daddy-yankee-20120806-001","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Randy Lewis"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#nothing-slow-about-it-despacito-is-now-the-most-streamed-song-ever"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageAs the final days of MTV's \"Teen Wolf\" loom, the cable network is looking ahead to what could fill the hunky, teenage wolf-boy-sized hole in its schedule.The answer?

The final 10 episodes will play out over the next few months, when the back half of Season 6 begins July 30.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:54:26.276Z","datePublished":"2017-07-19T15:11:00.000Z","headline":"‘Teen Wolf’ might be howling a different tune on MTV","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c4c6078/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1644x925+78+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F47%2F40f44827e57d94ead11b761527ad%2Fimg-596f6a6c-turbine-la-1500473960-np4kdl8szn-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Libby Hill"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#teen-wolf-might-be-howling-a-different-tune-on-mtv"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Image QuoteFROM THE ARCHIVES: Benedict Cumberbatch, the thinking man's alpha wolf","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:01:35.167Z","datePublished":"2017-07-19T15:05:00.000Z","headline":"A Star Is Born: Benedict Cumberbatch turns 41 today","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e587b44/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+448/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff6%2F52%2Fc08ca3289cba4bd59b5802031947%2Fimg-596c7db4-turbine-la-et-benedict-cumberbatch-photo","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Los Angeles Times Staff"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#a-star-is-born-benedict-cumberbatch-turns-41-today"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageLos Angeles Times staff writer Carolina A.

Kelly denies new sexual misconduct allegationsThe lengthy BuzzFeed report is written by DeRogatis, the former Chicago Sun-Times reporter who in 2000 co-bylined a story with Abdon Pallasch that outlined Kelly's history of alleged sexual abuse, citing court records and interviews that contended the star had a history of preying on teenaged women, some believed to be as young as 15. Two years later the Sun-Times reported that Chicago police we investigating a videotape that allegedly showed Kelly having sex with an underage girl.Kelly was subsequently acquitted on charges of child pornography. He has settled multiple lawsuits involving sexual misconduct allegations.In the BuzzFeed story, Kelly is accused of holding several women against their will at homes he owns in Illinois, where the age of consent is 17, and in Georgia, where the age of consent is reached at age 16.DeRogatis interviewed several of the parents as well as three women identified as former members of Kelly's inner circle --Cheryl Mack, Kitti Jones and Asante McGee -- who accuse Kelly of exerting \"mind control\" over the women who are staying in those residences.The story alleges that Kelly imposes strict rules of conduct on young women mostly in their late teens and early to mid-20s, limiting their ability to contact anyone but him and his entourage and punishing those who violate any of those rules.According to Mack, Jones and McGee, Kelly \"controls every aspect of their lives: dictating what they eat, how they dress, when they bathe, when they sleep, and how they engage in sexual encounters that he records,\" DeRogatis writes.He also notes that \"the law says that consenting adults may take part in any relationship they want, no matter how nontraditional. Welfare checks by police in both Illinois and Georgia in the past year didn’t lead to any charges; in January, the aspiring singer from Georgia told Cook County police she was 'fine and did not want to be bothered.'”ALSOAaron Carter, arrested on suspicion of DUI, slams brother Nick Carter for supportive tweetMel B ordered to pay $40,000 per month to ex Stephen Belafonte, despite abuse claimsRapper DMX pleads not guilty to tax fraud, facing allegations he owes $1.7 million to the IRSFor the Record (July 17, 2017, 6 p.m.): An earlier version of this story misreported numerous details regarding the past allegations against R.

(Emphasis ours.)Instead of focusing solely on Delta, Coulter also let loose on the woman who had the misfortune of sitting in Coulter's original seat, as if part of a nefarious plot to ruin her day.\"So glad I took time [to] investigate the aircraft & PRE-BOOK a specific seat on @Delta, so some woman could waltz at the last min & take my seat,\" Coulter fumed Saturday. Most egregious to Coulter seems to be that the \"other woman\" in this case was short, as compared to her own 6-foot frame.\"Hey @Delta, if it was so important for the dachshund-legged woman to take my seat, she should have BOOKED THE SEAT IN ADVANCE. Like I did,\" she continued Sunday morning. Tweet TweetDelta finally responded to Coulter's extensive complaints with a statement Sunday night.\"We are sorry that the customer did not receive the seat she reserved and paid for. More importantly, we are disappointed that the customer has chosen to publicly attack our employees and other customers by posting derogatory and slanderous comments and photos in social media. Her actions are unnecessary and unacceptable.                    \"Each of our employees is charged with treating each other as well as our customers with dignity and respect. And we hold each other accountable when that does not happen. \"Delta expects mutual civility throughout the entire travel experience.\"We will refund Ms. Coulter's $30 for the preferred seat on the exit row that she purchased,\" the statement read.Oh, dang, that's cold. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Coulter had little interest in being shamed by the airline, at which point she dropped the F-bomb.Not that one; the political one.\"But I love @Delta declaring my tweets unacceptable. @Delta now dictating acceptable conduct off the plane. NOT fascist at all. #Resist,\" Coulter fumed in response to Delta's response. TweetHowever, it's important to keep in mind what truly matters in all this: Coulter claims that it cost $10,000 of her time to choose the perfect seat for this flight. TweetAnn. Come on. Just check SeatGuru like the rest of us and call it a day. Or hire an assistant. Or book first class. Otherwise, welcome to the little indignities of economy-class air travel.As of Monday morning, Coulter was still tweeting about the incident. ALSOUnited Airlines considers reselling seats to travelers who will pay moreAnn Coulter, free speech and UC Berkeley: How a talk became a political bombshellAn airplane video, an unhappy family: How confusing rules put Delta in the hot seatA new look at another bad landing: How Harrison Ford missed a runway","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:59:52.811Z","datePublished":"2017-07-17T15:29:00.000Z","headline":"Ann Coulter wages a Twitter war on Delta -- and the airline dishes it right back to her","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Libby Hill"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#ann-coulter-wages-a-twitter-war-on-delta-and-the-airline-dishes-it-right-back-to-her"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Image QuoteFROM THE ARCHIVES: Sutherland's 'Station'For the record: A previous version of this post incorrectly listed Sutherland's age as 85.

Kim, the acting U.S. attorney for New York who will preside over the case, in a statement about the indictment. Per Kim, the rapper \"went out of his way\" to evade his tax obligations and attempted to conceal hefty portions of his income through an elaborate (and enduring — he's supposedly been at it for years) smoke-and-mirrors act that included avoiding personal bank accounts, opening accounts under false identities and paying for personal expenses exclusively in cash. DMX managed to skirt some $1.7 million in federal tax obligations, the prosecution said.In addition to tax evasion, he faces charges of failing to file a tax return and corruptly trying to obstruct and impede the due administration of IRS laws.“Celebrity rapper or not, all Americans must pay their taxes,” Kim said in the statement. \"Together, with our partners at the IRS, we will pursue those who deliberately and criminally evade this basic obligation of citizenship.\"Though this isn't DMX's first confrontation with the law, it is a potentially formidable one. If found guilty, he could face up to 44 years in federal prison.The Associated Press contributed to this report. Updated, 3:23 p.m.: This article was updated with a quote from DMX as well as plea and bond information. This story was first published at 11:22 a.m.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:58:05.949Z","datePublished":"2017-07-14T22:23:00.000Z","headline":"Rapper DMX pleads not guilty to tax fraud, facing allegations he owes $1.7 million to the IRS","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a4e33cc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+176/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F52%2F78%2Fe1eef1a42d42d7639193105d5165%2Fimg-5968fd97-turbine-la-dmx-20170714","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Emily Mae Czachor"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#rapper-dmx-pleads-not-guilty-to-tax-fraud-facing-allegations-he-owes-1-7-million-to-the-irs"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageKid Rock dropped two new songs and their corresponding music videos overnight as Thursday turned into Friday — the clincher to a week of bold statements in which the Detroit singer appeared to declare he's running for the Senate.After teasing an imminent \"major announcement\" on Wednesday, Rock tweeted a picture of a campaign yard sign reading \"Kid Rock for U.S. Senate,\" accompanied by a link to a campaign-style website offering merchandise for sale and flashing slogans such as \"Pimp of the Nation\" and \"Party to the People.\"  And while there was skepticism, the 46-year-old singer born Robert James Ritchie is insisting he means what he says.\"It's not a hoax,\" he wrote in a post on his personal website Thursday evening. \"It's a strategy.\"\"Like politicians write books during their campaigns, I'm planning on putting out music during mine and IT ALL STARTS TONIGHT AT MIDNIGHT,\" he continued.He also responded to incumbent Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who'd tweeted, \"I know we both share a love of music. I concede he's better at playing guitar and I'll keep doing what I do best: fighting for Michigan.\"His take? \"I concede she is better at playing politics than I am, so I'll keep doing what I do best, which is being a voice for tax paying, hardworking AMERICANS,\" said Rock, who hasn't kept his Trump-supporting ideology under wraps. He became politicized, according to Rolling Stone, after his hometown of Detroit filed for bankruptcy.But until he files with the Federal Election Commission, the Internet is likely to keep wondering whether it's all a Trump-style marketing campaign for songs \"Po-Dunk\" and \"Greatest Show on Earth\"The \"Kid Rock for U.S. Senate\" website diverts from the typical parameters associated with campaign-affiliated sites in a number of ways. For example, campaign sites must confirm that potential donors are U.S. citizens before completing any transactions. The Kid Rock site redirects visitors to a third-party webpage, hosted by the Warner Bros. record label, to seal its sales. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for one, is taking Kid Rock seriously. She's already addressed her supporters with a fundraising email titled \"Senator Kid Rock (R-MI.)\"“Well, maybe this is all a joke — but we all thought Donald Trump was joking when he rode down the escalator at Trump Tower and announced his campaign, too,\" Warren said, as reported by the Boston Herald. “And sure,\" she added, \"maybe this is just a marketing gimmick for a new album or tour — but we all thought Donald Trump was just promoting his reality TV show, too.\" Tweet","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:01:39.172Z","datePublished":"2017-07-14T22:07:00.000Z","headline":"Kid Rock for U.S. Senate? ‘It’s not a hoax,’ he says. ‘It’s a strategy.’","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f31ce1c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2Fce%2F9b313e63e70b571d32d543ba7208%2Fimg-571f9f25-turbine-la-1461690213-snap-photo","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Emily Mae Czachor"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#kid-rock-for-u-s-senate-its-not-a-hoax-he-says-its-a-strategy"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Image\"Having a Moment\" is a new weekly feature that spotlights the people and trends we all seem to be talking about.The year is 1937, and a plane equipped with all of the latest equipment — relying on both radio and celestial navigation and flown by one of the most famous aviators in the world — goes missing in the Pacific Ocean.This is the story of Amelia Earhart, whose untimely death 80 years ago continues to spawn obsessive theories as to what really happened to her.But despite all the theories, one fact remains: Amelia Earhart, born in 1897, is super dead.Read More","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:57:36.400Z","datePublished":"2017-07-14T18:36:00.000Z","headline":"Having a Moment: Amelia Earhart may be dead, but her mystique lives on","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6e6bd51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+320/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc0%2F98%2F80df7bf9fd564b0caea4e82e72e8%2Fimg-532d92e4-turbine-la-la-ig-phoenix-058-jpg-20140321","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Libby Hill"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#having-a-moment-amelia-earhart-may-be-dead-but-her-mystique-lives-on"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"The galaxy far, far away got a little bit closer Thursday night in Anaheim when the Walt Disney Co. provided the first-ever look at its upcoming \"Star Wars\"-themed attraction, or \"Star Wars land,\" as it's being referred to by fans. The attraction is under construction at Disneyland in Anaheim and at Disney’s Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Fla.

He was 33.After the Wednesday afternoon fall, Bernecker was flown to the Atlanta Medical Center, where he died at 6:30 p.m., Coweta County Coroner Richard Hawk told The Times on Friday. Variety reported that Bernecker fell more than 20 feet from a balcony onto a concrete floor, suffering a head injury, and immediately was transported by helicopter to the hospital. An assistant director told police the stuntman missed a safety cushion \"just by inches\" and tried to stop his fall \"by grabbing onto the railing with both hands\" right after he began falling, TMZ reported Friday. The death, from blunt force trauma, was ruled accidental, said Hawk, who added that the coroner's office and sheriff's department both had closed their cases.\"We are saddened to report that John Bernecker, a talented stuntman for 'The Walking Dead' and numerous other television shows and films, suffered serious injuries from a tragic accident on set,\" AMC said in a statement to several outlets Thursday, before news of Bernecker's death was made public.\"He was immediately transported to an Atlanta hospital, and we have temporarily shut down production. We are keeping John and his family in our thoughts and prayers.\"Bernecker had an extensive career as a stunt performer, appearing in recent films including \"Get Out,' \"Logan\" and \"The Fate of the Furious.\"His death is the latest tragedy to strike a film set mid-project.During the filming of \"Resident Evil: The Final Chapter\" in September 2015, stuntwoman Olivia Jackson suffered extensive injuries after a motorcycle accident involving a metal camera arm. Jackson’s injuries included a severed artery in her neck, a degloved face, several nerves torn from her spinal column and arm injuries so severe it led to eventual amputation. She spent two weeks in a medically induced coma.In December, several months after Jackson's accident on set, another crew member on \"Resident Evil\" was killed during filming. Ricardo Cornelius died from injuries suffered when a U.S. Army Hummer slipped while a team was manually rotating it and pinned Cornelius beneath it.A 2015 story from The Times examined the circumstances surrounding the increased number of fatalities during filming in recent years, with some industry experts blaming the need to get increasingly dramatic footage in order to stay competitive.\"It's truly remarkable to me that production companies can use ultra-advanced technology to make spectacular films but too often they won't spend the modest resources necessary to make sure their workers are not injured or killed on the job,\" David Michaels, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's assistant secretary of labor said in 2015.Deadline reported Friday morning that both OSHA and SAG-AFTRA have opened investigations into the circumstances surrounding Bernecker's death.\"The Walking Dead\" has filmed in Georgia since the show's inception in 2010. The state's generous tax incentives have sparked an influx of movie and television productions opting to film in Georgia.There are over three dozen projects currently filming in Georgia, according to the state website, including television series \"The Gospel of Kevin\" and \"Halt and Catch Fire,\" as well as 2019 feature film \"Godzilla: King of the Monsters.\"  The Gregg Allman biopic \"Midnight Rider\" also was filming in Georgia when a tragic 2014 train accident killed crew member Sarah Jones, resulting in involuntary manslaughter charges against the film's director, Randall Miller.Jones' parents are embroiled in a civil trial with railroad company CSX over charges of negligence in her death.

Manning cracked a joke about Kevin Durant (who was clearly not amused) RawHtmlModuleManning kicked off this year's awards show with a series of thinly veiled digs masquerading as punchlines. But in his most contentious quip, he targeted newly designated NBA champion Kevin Durant. Despite uproarious cackles from the audience (including Durant's mother), Durant remained staunchly unamused.  Referencing the success of the U.S. Women's Gymnastics team at the Rio Olympics, Manning said: \"Our gymnastics team was so dominant that Kevin Durant told me he wants to play for them next year.\"(For context: In an unprecedented career move last summer, Durant dumped the Oklahoma City Thunder — his team of two years — for the Golden State Warriors. His decision was met with a whole lot of criticism because Durant was pretty clearly just angling for his first championship ring.)True to form, the fast-acting people of Twitter swiftly recognized Durant's solemn-faced reaction as prime meme material. Tweet2. Julian Edelman fired back at Manning's quipsManning roasted several folks throughout the night, but in his acceptance speech for best game, New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman served the multi-champion quarterback his due comeuppance.\"You know, I never thought I'd say this, but Peyton Manning is kind of killing it,\" Edelman paused. \"We are indoors, though.\"It was a particularly egregious jab, playing off the semi-farcical remark that Manning plays better under a dome than he does outdoors.3. Michelle Obama paid her respects to Eunice Kennedy Shriver's memory The former first lady was presenting the prestigious Arthur Ashe Courage Award, which was given posthumously to Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who founded the Special Olympics in 1968. The award reflected the tone of the entire evening, which, in large part, paid homage to individuals living with disabilities. In lieu of Shriver's physical presence, Obama delivered a speech in her memory — and it was a tearjerker.\"[She was] a woman who believed that everyone has something to contribute and everyone deserves a chance to push themselves, to find out what they're made of and to compete and win,\" Obama said. \"She knew that when we give others the chance to fulfill their greatest potential, we all win.\"4. Jarrius \"JJ\" Robertson, 15, wowed the audience with his moving acceptance speechRobertson, known to some as the official \"hype man\" for the New Orleans Saints, was the evening's recipient of the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance — an acknowledgment of his strength amid a lifelong battle with a chronic liver disease. He exuded a wise-beyond-his-years understanding of the world around him, and he certainly knows how to command a stage.5. Manning showed his comedic chops TweetIn a pre-recorded comedy sketch (think \"SNL\" by way of ESPN), Manning ditched his title of \"ESPY host\" for \"Super Bowl party host\" — as well as 18-layer-dip aficionado. As on-screen Manning relived the Patriots' famed Super Bowl comeback, he delivered a flustered performance as a peeved football enthusiast.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:51:55.340Z","datePublished":"2017-07-13T17:31:00.000Z","headline":"From low blows to tender speeches, watch the 5 must-see moments from the ESPY Awards","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8ad3920/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x576+0+67/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0b%2F87%2F504e4bd8207b69388bd29e69ee8d%2Fimg-5967aa36-turbine-la-peyton-manning-espys","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Emily Mae Czachor"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#from-low-blows-to-tender-speeches-watch-the-5-must-see-moments-from-the-espy-awards"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Shia LaBeouf made a \"sincere apology\" to  Savannah, Ga., police officers he railed against when he was arrested for public drunkenness over the weekend, saying that he is taking active steps to secure his sobriety.The actor, whose racist, expletive-laden exchanges were caught on officers' body cameras and published online by TMZ, posted his statement on Twitter on Wednesday following his latest brush with law enforcement.

It is a new low,\" LaBeouf continued in his apology. \"A low I hope is a bottom.\"The actor hoped to be forgiven for his mistakes and admitted to \"struggling with addiction publicly for far too long.\"\"I am actively taking steps toward securing my sobriety,\" he said, though he did not elaborate on what that would mean.In addition to the public drunkenness allegation, LaBeouf was also arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct and obstruction. He was released from jail after posting $7,000 bond on charges of public drunkenness and appeared back on the set of his film \"The Peanut Butter Falcon\" on Monday, TMZ said.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:52:20.607Z","datePublished":"2017-07-13T15:23:00.000Z","headline":"Shia LaBeouf says behavior during Georgia arrest is ‘a new low’","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Nardine Saad"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#shia-labeouf-says-behavior-during-georgia-arrest-is-a-new-low"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Image QuoteFROM THE ARCHIVES: Patrick Stewart: ‘Next Generation,’ ‘X-Men’ and Hollywood history","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:58:04.729Z","datePublished":"2017-07-13T14:00:00.000Z","headline":"A Star Is Born: Patrick Stewart turns 77 today","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a819df/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff1%2Fd9%2Faf1ec612a39eed47945ccd2f29eb%2Fimg-5963212e-turbine-la-et-patrick-stewart-photo","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Los Angeles Times Staff"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#a-star-is-born-patrick-stewart-turns-77-today"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageFor \"Game of Thrones\" fans scavenging the Internet for spoilers about Season 7, the return of one particular, potentially pivotal, character from the past has been an open secret for some time.But with Joe Dempsie's appearance at the world premiere of the first episode of the acclaimed HBO drama in Los Angeles on Wednesday, it is official: Gendry is coming back.While Dempsie was mum on the details of what his blacksmithing-secret son of Robert Baratheon character has been up to since we last saw him rowing away from Dragonstone in the third season finale, he was excited about rejoining the acclaimed drama. PHOTOS: \"Game of Thrones\" Season 7 premiere >>We won't spoil at what point Gendry pops up in the season but in a chat with The Times a few hours before the premiere, Dempsie said he was relieved by the reaction from the diehard fans who sleuthed it out.   \"Very fortunately, from what I've seen it's been nothing but interest and excitement and some quite witty memes.\"  Tweet","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:48:22.528Z","datePublished":"2017-07-13T03:29:00.000Z","headline":"Gendry’s back!

I wouldn't worry. The Force is still very much with it,\" Harrelson, who plays a young Han Solo's mentor in the movie, recently told the Hollywood Reporter.In his interview published online on Wednesday, the \"Cheers\" alum explained how he turned down the role twice, just as he did with the part of Katniss Everdeen's mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, in the blockbuster \"Hunger Games\" franchise.\"I didn't have any idea it would be that big, but I didn't think it was a good part. I was wrong. It was a terrific part, and it was a terrific thing, but thank God [\"Hunger Games\" director] Gary Ross called me,\" Harrelson said. \"And [executive producer] Alli Shearmur too. I turned [the Han Solo movie] down twice too, and the same person, Alli, wouldn't take no for an answer.\"The genre-jumping star, who plays a villain in 20th Century Fox's \"War for the Planet of the Apes,\" teased some of the tight-lipped secrecy around the \"Star Wars\" project — \"You get an e-reader; you don't get a script. They give it to you, and you give it back after you read it\" —  and his experience with ousted directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who were abruptly fired before being replaced by Howard.\"I met with [Lord and Miller] one night, and we hung out and we went over to Matthew Freud's and played ping-pong and just had a great time. They were really good guys,\" he said. \"I've been enjoying it [since then], especially because we just went to [shoot at] the Dolomites in Italy. [Co-star] Thandie Newton said, 'It's like being at camp 'cause you got everybody together,' and we had a couple of epic parties.\"The actor said he was tipped off by Shearmur that Howard would take over for the co-directors. Harrelson said he had shot one day with him and called him \"a wonderful guy.\" ImageHe also talked about how he's still 14 months weed-free, and shed light on the infamous 2002 incident in which he was photographed by a British paparazzo who caught him in bed with three women — none of whom were his wife, Laura Louie.\"How did I apologize? You know, just your standard Texan grovel. But she forgave me, and we're still together,\" he said. The same week of the tabloid incident, Harrelson went to jail after a kerfuffle with a taxi driver. He said it was one of the worst nights of his life and that he worked hard to repress it. But he and Louie drafted it into a screenplay that was eventually streamed into theaters. \"I would've paid a large sum to just excise that week from my life — the tabloid thing, the incident with the cops. It all happened around the same time. It does happen to me in spurts, trouble,\" he said. \"But I started thinking, there is some merit to this story. Thematically, you have a guy who has it all, doesn't realize he has it all, gets reminded how lucky he is and then has a shot at redemption. There's something about that theme that really resonates with me.\"","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:55:12.544Z","datePublished":"2017-07-12T18:23:00.000Z","headline":"Woody Harrelson on Han Solo film: ‘I wouldn’t worry.

Later, the director — who has stated that he will not comment any further about the child-abuse charges — issued a statement calling the protest \"stupid,\" according to a German news outlet, SHZ.Allen has been the focus of controversy since 1992, when his relationship with actress Mia Farrow exploded in a conflagration of tabloid headlines after it was revealed that he had become romantically involved with her adoptive daughter, Soon Yi-Previn, whom he later married.At the time, authorities investigated allegations that Allen had sexually abused the couple's adoptive daughter, Dylan, who was then 7, but no charges were brought.Dylan Farrow revived those allegations three years ago in an open letter to Allen published by the New York Times, calling him \"a living testament to the way our society fails the survivors of sexual assault and abuse.\"Allen vehemently denied the claims in his own New York Times op-ed, saying that Farrow had \"been cheated out of having a loving father and exploited by a mother more interested in her own festering anger than her daughter's well-being.\"","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:00:53.960Z","datePublished":"2017-07-12T18:14:00.000Z","headline":"Topless protesters disrupt Woody Allen jazz concert over abuse allegations","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff7fc10/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+69/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F02%2F2d%2F134c1e182c1142a38d4f8a0f8f8e%2Fla-et-cm-woody-allen-jazz-los-angeles-20150809","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Josh Rottenberg"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#topless-protesters-disrupt-woody-allen-jazz-concert-over-abuse-allegations"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Tuesday was Donald Trump Jr.'s day in the glare of comedy.

However, the two-time Oscar-winning screenwriter has a storied history of unfinished projects. ImageCult leader Charles Manson and several of his followers were convicted of killing \"Valley of the Dolls\" actress Sharon Tate, who was married to filmmaker Roman Polanski and eight months pregnant at the time, and six other people during a brutal rampage over two nights in August 1969.

There is a catch, though. The winning bidder won’t have the rights to the music and therefore won’t be able to distribute it.

Will Byers has been rescued from the Upside Down but a bigger, sinister entity still threatens those who survived.\"Joining the beloved original cast (minus Barb -- R.I.P.) for Season 2 will be Paul Reiser, Sean Astin, Will Chase and Brett Gelman.Watch the teaser below.

I’ve never over-analyzed what I do; I just do it. Music has to be about just doing it and that’s the way the blues works -- it’s an attitude.“I was lucky to have met people who were the real thing -- people like John Lee Hooker, Jimmy Witherspoon, Bo Diddley, Little Walter and Mose Allison,” he added. “I got to hang out with them and absorb what they did. They were people with no ego whatsoever and they helped me learn a lot.”The connective thread between those songs and the new material Morrison has written, he said, is that “they’re performance oriented. Each song is like a story and I’m performing that story. That’s been forgotten over years because people over-analyze things. I was a performer before I started writing songs and I’ve always felt like that’s what I do.”His latest round of U.S. shows opens Sept. 10 with his appearance with Willie Nelson at the Outlaw Music Festival in Hershey, Pa., and brings him back to the Southland for stops Oct. 13-14 at the Show theater at Agua Caliente Resort in Rancho Mirage, near Palm Springs.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:01:52.007Z","datePublished":"2017-07-11T16:03:00.000Z","headline":"Van Morrison will salute his blues heroes on new album, ‘Roll With the Punches’","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8122970/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+90/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F73%2F56%2F1b455d5c49cf101bc6d70f868a1a%2Fla-et-ms-van-morrison-shrine-auditorium-review-001","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Randy Lewis"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#van-morrison-will-salute-his-blues-heroes-on-new-album-roll-with-the-punches"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Forgive Kermit if he has a frog in his throat. The Associated Press reported Tuesday that the head of the Muppet brood will be getting a new puppeteer and voice actor, the first Kermit-related change since the death of creator Jim Henson in 1990.Steve Whitmire, who began work on \"The Muppet Show\" in 1978 and inherited the role of Kermit when Henson died, no longer will be working with Muppets.Replacing the veteran voice actor is Matt Vogel, only the third puppeteer to take on the full-time mantle of Kermit the Frog since the character's creation in 1955.The changing of the frog guard starts immediately, with Vogel's first performance as Kermit to be released next week on the official \"Muppet Thought of the Week\" video.  There's no word on what will become of the other characters Whitmire portrayed within the Muppets, including Rizzo the Rat, which he created, and Beaker, which he inherited.Representatives for Disney, which owns Muppets Studio, did not immediately respond Tuesday morning to The Times' request for comment about Whitmire's departure.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:01:29.419Z","datePublished":"2017-07-11T15:55:00.000Z","headline":"After 27 years, Kermit the Frog is getting a new voice","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Libby Hill"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#after-27-years-kermit-the-frog-is-getting-a-new-voice"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"YouTube viewers have been seeing Wiz Khalifa's \"See You Again\" again and again.

The family reportedly explained his death in an effort to help others who might be struggling with addiction. Ellis, who was 39 when he died Saturday, played gay short-order cook Lafayette Reynolds through the seven-season run of HBO's sexy vampires-and-werewolves show. His cause of death was first given only as heart failure. His fellow cast members from \"The Help\" were among those on social media who remembered him fondly, with Octavia Spencer — who also worked with him on \"The Soloist\" — saying that her heart broke for his family.\"Needless to say he was gorgeous, sexy,\" she continued. \"But his talent had me speechless. We became instant friends after that. He was sooooo funny. I miss him.\"\"We didn't even scratch the surface of seeing what this artist was capable of,\" Jessica Chastain said. \"My love to the family of this spectacular man.\"Said Viola Davis: \"He was like my son.

A published playwright himself. \"I think it would be fair to say that he taught all of us that intent and courage and fearlessness and freedom are the aspects of playing make-believe that spark the corners of the room where the dark is most impenetrable; to shine a light on those corners within ourselves is the very reason we go back time and again to Movies, TV shows and Theatre.

Daniel Craig.The British actor has reportedly signed on for the 25th Bond film despite his notorious disdain for playing the super spy. Craig said in 2015 that he would \"rather slash [his] wrists\" than return to the role — and if he did play 007 again, \"it would be for the money.\"The U.K.'s Mirror reported that Craig decided to stay on for Bond 25 after hearing of the wealth of British talent eyed to replace him. Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, James Norton and Aidan Turner were among the rumored contenders.This would be Craig's fifth Bond flick since embodying Ian Fleming's secret service agent in the 2006 installment, \"Casino Royale.\" He's the sixth actor to play the master spy since the first Bond film, \"Dr. No,\" debuted in 1962.Other big names swirling around Bond 25 are singer Adele and director Christopher Nolan.The Mirror reported that producer Barbara Broccoli is \"determined\" to bring the English songbird back after her performance of \"Skyfall,\" the theme song to the 2012 Bond film of the same name, earned her Oscar, Grammy, Golden Globe and Brit awards. Broccoli is said to be \"talking the singer round\" and insiders believe Craig and Adele are the franchise's \"winning team.\"According to the Telegraph, Nolan is also being eyed to direct the next film. The Academy Award-winning director, who also helmed Warner Bros.' \"Dark Knight\" trilogy, has been in talks with producers but sounded reluctant to step in for Sam Mendes, who directed \"Skyfall\" and \"Spectre.\"\"I've spoken to the producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson over the years,\" Nolan recently told Playboy. \"I deeply love the character, and I'm always excited to see what they do with it. Maybe one day that would work out. You'd have to be needed, if you know what I mean. It has to need reinvention; it has to need you. And they're getting along very well.\"\"Skyfall\" and \"Spectre\" screenwriter John Logan is also said to be involved in the upcoming project, and reports suggest that Bond 25 will start filming next year.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:54:42.345Z","datePublished":"2017-07-10T16:13:00.000Z","headline":"Daniel Craig reported to sign on for ‘Bond 25' despite disdain for 007 franchise","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Nardine Saad"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#daniel-craig-reported-to-sign-on-for-bond-25-despite-disdain-for-007-franchise"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageIt’s official: Jay-Z is going on the road.After months of speculation, the rap mogul announced his first solo tour in four years on Monday in support of his comeback album, “4:44.”The 4:44 Tour will take Jay to North American arenas this fall.

Lafayette brought pointed humor to Alan Ball's acclaimed vampire drama that many considered an analogy for the gay rights struggle.  As news of Ellis' passing quickly spread, a scene where he marches out from behind the griddle to confront a trio of homophobic diners was widely circulated on Twitter.In a statement, Ball called Ellis \"a singular talent whose creativity never ceased to amaze me.  Working with him was a privilege.”HBO echoed Ball’s sentiments in its own statement, “We were extremely saddened to hear of the passing of Nelsan Ellis. Nelsan was a long-time member of the HBO family whose groundbreaking portrayal of Lafayette will be remembered fondly within the overall legacy of True Blood. Nelsan will be dearly missed by his fans and all of us at HBO.”Most recently, Ellis joined the season five cast of “Elementary,” playing Shinwell Johnson, a former drug dealer (and former patient of Lucy Liu’s Watson) trying to make up for his life of crime.  Shinwell, who was named for a character that appeared in the original Sherlock Holmes story “The Illustrious Client,” died this season after infiltrating a gang known as the South Bronx Killas. ","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:49:58.651Z","datePublished":"2017-07-08T21:07:00.000Z","headline":"Nelsan Ellis, who played Lafayette Reynolds on ‘True Blood,’ is dead at 39","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9125d97/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F43%2F69%2Fe0e4e4955740995b6d1d0efc3949%2Fla-1499547159-156xr6bwr0-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Jessica Gelt"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#nelsan-ellis-who-played-lafayette-reynolds-on-true-blood-is-dead-at-39"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageAn aerial dancer performing before a Green Day concert Friday night in Spain fell an estimated 100 feet to his death, the BBC has reported. Pedro Aunión Monroy died at the Mad Cool festival in Madrid, his fall from a lighted cage over the stage captured in video posted on YouTube.Festival organizers told neither the audience nor the night's bands that Monroy had died, the BBC said. Green Day tweeted that it did not know of the death until after the band had performed.  Tweet","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:55:36.472Z","datePublished":"2017-07-08T19:12:00.000Z","headline":"Aerial dancer falls to his death before Green Day performance in Madrid","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a4b2c5c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+434/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F24%2F66%2F4e339ac163712082fdd07c7eb054%2Fla-et-cm-pedro-aunion-monroy-20170708","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Craig Nakano"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#aerial-dancer-falls-to-his-death-before-green-day-performance-in-madrid"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageActor Shia LaBeouf has been released from a Georgia jail after posting $7,000 bond on charges of public drunkenness.The Chatham County Sheriff's Office says the 31-year-old was arrested at 4 a.m. Saturday by the Savannah Police Department and released.In addition to the public drunkenness allegation, he was also arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct and obstruction.

(Or perhaps when your parents are Beyoncé and Jay Z, it's already in your DNA.)We've heard her wail on Jay Z's \"Glory\" -- a 2012 tribute anthem to infant Blue Ivy herself -- and babble in the background of Beyoncé's 2013 track \"Blue\" (another homage to you-know-who).But now, at the ripe old age of 5, Blue Ivy is making her official rap debut -- and the Internet is calling her a sensation.The pint-sized prodigy raps for 45 seconds, sandwiched between her father's verses, on \"Blue's Freestyle/We Family\" -- one of three bonus tracks featured on the physical edition of \"4:44,\" which was released Friday after nearly a week-long exclusive on the streaming service Tidal.Her remarkably arresting (even if a bit obscure) verse kicks off: \"Everything, everything is my only single thing/ Everything I hear is my answer...I never hear that/ I be in the posse/ Never seen a ceiling in my whole life.\" And while it is periodically difficult to decipher Blue Ivy's words (again, she's 5), the freestyle refrain is crystal-clear: \"Boom shakalaka/ Boom shakalaka/ Everything in shaka/ Everything in faka.\" ImageJay Z's acclaimed 13th studio album had its initial release last week on Tidal and has already earned platinum certification. But despite its wide success, the rapper was recently criticized by the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish organization dedicated to identifying and combating anti-Semitism. The group has taken issue with certain lyrics on Jay Z's new song \"The Story of O.J.\": “You wanna know what’s more important than throwin’ away money at a strip club? Credit / You ever wonder why the Jewish people own all the property in America? This how they did it.\"In an interview with Rolling Stone, a representative for the ADL said that while the organization believes Jay Z meant no harm, those lyrics are problematic.\"We know that Jay Z is someone who has used his celebrity in the past to speak out responsibly and forcefully against the evils of racism and anti-Semitism,\" the rep said.\"The lyric does seem to play into deep-seated anti-Semitic stereotypes about Jews and money,\" the rep added. \"The idea that Jews 'own all the property' in this country and have used credit to financially get ahead are odious and false. Yet, such notions have lingered in society for decades, and we are concerned that this lyric could feed into preconceived notions about Jews and alleged Jewish 'control' of the banks and finance.\"\"4:44\" is now available to stream on Apple Music, iTunes and Amazon -- most everywhere, that is, except for Spotify.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:50:03.092Z","datePublished":"2017-07-07T19:07:00.000Z","headline":"At 5, Blue Ivy Carter makes her rap debut on Jay Z’s new album.

Motor City Drum Ensemble, Perfume Genius or King Krule? Frank Ocean or [insert would-be replacement headliner here]?The annual FYF Fest has announced the set times for its upcoming event, which takes place at Exposition Park on the weekend of July 21-23, and fans will have to start wrestling with such first-world concerns as whether to check out Solange or Blonde Redhead. The 14th annual event, which got its start as a DIY punk festival in Echo Park, continues to expand its range. This year's roster will include performances across six stages by artists including Missy Elliott, Bjork, Solange, Frank Ocean, Nine Inch Nails, Erykah Badu and dozens more.Promoted by FYF and Goldenvoice, the festival is known for its prescience. Over the years it's helped bring to prominence artists including Mac DeMarco, the Head and the Heart, Joyce Manor and Future Islands, among others. The biggest question mark? Frank Ocean's confirmed set. The singer and songwriter has been booked at other festivals this year, but has so far canceled both Sasquatch in Washington and Hangout in Gulf Shores, Ala. Hangout is also co-produced by Goldenvoice. Whether Ocean will indeed land on FYF's main stage remains an open question. Although there are no indications that the soul singer is wavering, his track record is spotty. In 2015, Ocean canceled his FYF headlining appearance on less than a week's notice; Kanye West jumped in to fill the slot. The good news is that regardless of Ocean's ways -- to repeat, he's given no indication that he'll be a no-show -- the influential rap goddess Missy Elliott hasn't been known to flake on short notice. Her highly anticipated set will be her first U.S. concert since 2008 (not including her social-media-busting Super Bowl cameo with Katy Perry in 2015), and her only scheduled concert of 2017. Below: The clickable set times for the three-day event.

Called \"Praying,\" it's a defiant ballad about overcoming adversity that opens with a haunting spoken-word intro.\"Am I dead,\" she wonders, \"or is this one of those dreams, those horrible dreams that seem like they last forever?\"She continues: \"If there is a God or whatever, something, somewhere, why have I been abandoned by everyone and everything I've ever known, I've ever loved?\"It's the first track from her just-announced new album, \"Rainbow,\" which is to arrive on Aug. 11. The album is being released on Kemosabe Records, the Dr. Luke-owned imprint that was at the center of lawsuits for the last three years. Kemosabe is distributed by Sony Music Entertainment.  ImageAmong those who collaborate with Kesha (born Kesha Sebert) for \"Rainbow\" are Dolly Parton, who duets with her on the 1980 Pepe Sebert song \"Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You.\" Sebert, who, not coincidentally, is Kesha's mom, also helped write the Ben Folds-produced title track.The chart-topping producer-songwriter Ricky Reed (Wallpaper) also contributed. Kesha drafted members of Palm Desert rock band Eagles of Death Metal for a few songs, as well. Dr. Luke (Lukasz Gottwald), who helped propel Kesha to stardom through his co-production on songs including \"Tik Tok,\" \"Your Love Is My Drug\" and \"Die Young,\" is notably absent from the credits. That stands to reason. In October 2014, Kesha sued Gottwald in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleging that he \"sexually, physically, verbally and emotionally\" abused her starting when she was 18. Gottwald denied the charges and counter-sued her in New York, alleging defamation and breach of contract.In 2016, Kesha dropped her suit, stating in an Instagram post, “I need to get my music out. I have so much to say. This lawsuit is so heavy on my once free spirit, and I can only pray to one day feel that happiness again.\"\"Praying\" is her first musical endeavor in support of that goal.The video for the song alludes to past turmoil but embeds it within lyrics that address a spurned lover. \"Well, you almost had me fooled / Told me that I was nothing without you,\" she sings to open.\"You brought the flames and you put me through hell,\" she adds later, and it's hard not to think that Dr. Luke is in her cross hairs: \"I had to learn how to fight for myself / And we both know all the truth I could tell / I'll just say this is I wish you farewell.\"In a note to fans published on Lena Dunham's Lenny Letter, Kesha explained the genesis of \"Praying\": \"I have channeled my feelings of severe hopelessness and depression, I've overcome obstacles, and I have found strength in myself even when it felt out of reach.

TweetThe TV show's producers hope that Zeerak's reverence for Zari — a sharp, sweet young girl who is largely characterized by her enthusiasm for learning and career-focused ambition — will instill in young boys the idea that women's place in society extends beyond the home. Massood Sanjer, who heads the television network that broadcasts \"Baghch-e-Simsim,\" believes that introducing a boy character who not only respects his school-going older sister, but actually wants to be like her, will \"indirectly teach the kids to love their sisters.\"That'll be a lofty feat in Afghanistan, where 85% of the female population receives no formal education and the literacy rate among women is one of the lowest in the world. But as the only Afghan television program dedicated to children, \"Baghch-e-Simsim\" wields the potential for enormous influence. And the show intends to use it. \"People ... who have access to TV are watching and know the brand of the character,\" Sanjer said in an interview with AFP. \"So it is a very good sign that people love to learn and it is great to use media as an education tool for kids.\"","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:50:04.777Z","datePublished":"2017-07-05T18:01:00.000Z","headline":"Meet Zeerak, a new muppet on Afghanistan’s ‘Sesame Street’ who promotes gender equality","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/68bd44d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+94/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5f%2F2b%2Fc25d1effc33bd0acddb14c4d8250%2Fimg-595d21c9-turbine-la-zeerak-the-afghan-sesame-street-muppet-20170705","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Emily Mae Czachor"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#meet-zeerak-a-new-muppet-on-afghanistans-sesame-street-who-promotes-gender-equality"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe music industry continues to move headlong into a streaming future, according to Nielsen Music's annual midyear report of listening habits. The report, which was published Wednesday, shows that music streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal and others delivered a total of 184.3 billion on-demand audio streams, up from 113.5 billion during the same period a year ago, for an increase of 62%.Buoyed by the success of superstars such as Drake, Future, Ed Sheeran and the return of Taylor Swift's back catalog to major streaming platforms, the services surpassed a milestone in March, when more than 7 billion songs were accessed. But music streaming's success came at a cost: total album sales (purchased downloads and physical albums) declined by 18%, which was hastened by a 24% drop in digital track sales and a 20% drop in digital album sales. That number stands to reason: Why download a song when you can stream it for free on YouTube or as part of a platform subscription? ImageAmong the winners in the first half of 2017 were the British pop sensation Sheeran, Compton-bred rapper Kendrick Lamar and Puerto Rican pop star Luis Fonsi. Lamar's recent album, \"Damn,\" was at the top of the total album consumption chart, which calculates success based on a formula involving sales and streaming numbers. Sheeran's song \"The Shape of You\" has earned the most on-demand audio streams, accumulating 354 million this year. Lamar's song \"Humble\" followed with 345 million streams. Fonsi's collaboration with Justin Bieber and Daddy Yankee, \"Despacito,\" and Migos' \"Bad and Boujee\" also tallied huge numbers.Vinyl was another winner in the first half of the year. According to music tracking company BuzzAngle, which also just released its midyear report, sales of the resurgent format increased by 20% over 2016, and accounted for 4.9% of all physical album sales. CD sales dropped by nearly 4%. ImageVinyl fans couldn't get enough of the Beatles, according to Nielsen Music's report. Their album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" was the top seller on LP, racking up a relatively meager 39,000 hard copies.The soundtrack to \"La La Land\" was second, with 33,000 copies sold. Also earning sales in the category were the indie pop band Tennis' \"Yours Conditionally,\" Prince's \"Purple Rain\" and Amy Winehouse's \"Back to Black.\" Other notable calculations from BuzzAngle's report included a breakdown of which genres are most popular across streaming platforms.Hip-hop tracks constitute nearly 25% of all on-demand audio consumption, followed by pop (12.8%), R&B (9.3%) and country (7.2%).Drake is the most popular streaming artist in the U.S., with a tally of 3.7 billion spins (including audio and video). Coming in second is Future (2.65 billion), followed by Lamar (2.35 billion).When fans listen to albums, though, they continue to look to the past for the majority of their music. According to BuzzAngle's report, 51% of streams in 2017 have been for deep catalog titles, compared with 12% for brand new music.UPDATES11:44 a.m. This article was updated with new data from BuzzAngle's midyear report.This article was originally published at 10:51 a.m.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:00:05.165Z","datePublished":"2017-07-05T17:51:00.000Z","headline":"Music streaming shatters records, according to Nielsen Music report","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/13fd136/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+448/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F01%2Fed%2F3fffc43b08826040a860232343a0%2Fla-et-ms-streaming-illo-20170705","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Randall Roberts"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#music-streaming-shatters-records-according-to-nielsen-music-report"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe Ruderman Family Foundation, a leading organization advocating on behalf of disabled people, has come out against the forthcoming film “Blind.” The group accuses the movie of “crip-face” — akin to blackface — in its casting of the able-bodied Alec Baldwin as the blind lead. “Alec Baldwin in ‘Blind’ is just the latest example of treating disability as a costume,” Jay Ruderman, the foundation’s president, said in a statement. “We no longer find it acceptable for white actors to portray black characters. Disability as a costume needs to also become universally unacceptable.”“Blind,” which Vertical Entertainment will release July 14, stars Baldwin as a novelist who lost his wife and his sight in a car crash. Years later, he comes into contact with a married socialite, played by Demi Moore, who is forced to read to him as part of a plea bargain. The two begin a love affair forcing Moore’s character to choose between the novelist and her husband. VideoLast July, the foundation released its Ruderman White Paper on Employment of Actors With Disabilities in Television. The study found that despite those with disabilities representing nearly 20% of the country’s population, about 95% of characters with disabilities on television are played by able-bodied actors.Months later, in November, the organization hosted its first Studio-Wide Roundtable on Disability Inclusion. At that event, Marlee Matlin, perhaps the most visible and acclaimed disabled actress, spoke about the need for Hollywood to give disabled actors a chance.“There is something wrong with this picture,” said Matlin, who 30 years ago won an Oscar for her leading role in “Children of a Lesser God.“ “We as an industry keep talking about diversity — we know we have a problem. But, sadly, when we start speaking about diversity, disability seems to be left out far too often.”READ MORE: Marlee Matlin remains a champion for disabled actors, 30 years after winning her OscarDisabled actors and advocates plead to Hollywood: 'Give us a chance, please!'Why are we OK with disability drag in Hollywood?","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:54:37.154Z","datePublished":"2017-07-05T17:04:00.000Z","headline":"Disability organization condemns ‘Blind’ film for casting Alec Baldwin in lead role","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b8f235d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0e%2Fac%2Fcd514ccd32ffedb0443317146667%2Fla-1499272563-m3lwbe5ndw-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Tre’vell Anderson"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#disability-organization-condemns-blind-film-for-casting-alec-baldwin-in-lead-role"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"TweetOK, Honey!

The \"Galway Girl\" singer still retains his Twitter account, and images from his Instagram account continue to be cross-posted there. If nothing else, perhaps Sheeran will return to Twitter to continue to educate the masses on the functionality (and existence) of loopers.

It’s the most cathartic of post-9/11 movies, and an “Hour” that may well be Spike Lee’s finest.Read More","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:48:32.860Z","datePublished":"2017-07-04T15:00:00.000Z","headline":"From the Archives: Five American movies to watch on Independence Day","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/374b480/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1000x563+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2Fe0%2Fb8bf50e065a572b2683e7af40aeb%2F1000","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Justin Chang"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#from-the-archives-five-american-movies-to-watch-on-independence-day"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Image QuoteFROM THE ARCHIVES: Eva Marie Saint: Her Independence Is Blessed","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:58:20.534Z","datePublished":"2017-07-04T14:00:00.000Z","headline":"A Star Is Born: Eva Marie Saint turns 93 today","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1e79829/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa4%2F8d%2F012ed7ec79f656b3b1963967f7c7%2Fimg-595636eb-turbine-la-et-eva-marie-saint-photo2","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Los Angeles Times Staff"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#a-star-is-born-eva-marie-saint-turns-93-today"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageEven if hindsight is 20/20, it's fair to say the Los Angeles Times was never too keen on the Doors, at least not during the band's explosive rise out of L.A. in the mid-1960s. In honor of today's anniversary of frontman Jim Morrison's death in 1971, we revisited our archives to see how we reviewed the hometown heroes' local live performances in the '60s and '70s. It wasn't pretty.\"Perhaps Morrison should give up performing, which seems to be an effort for him, and concentrate on reciting and writing poetry,\" Donna Chick wrote in The Times in 1968.Ouch.Here are all the times we got the Doors wrong (or right, depending on your perspective).John Mendelson, reviewing a show at Aquarius Theatre, July 21, 1969:\" …an hour and a half of music and/or theatrics that was best described as dull.\"\"[Morrison’s] singing was quite timid. Each of the many times he confronted a vocal part above his ever-diminishing range he crept cautiously into a lower register, thus avoiding the ugly croaks that were once so much a part of his singing and rendering such screamers as 'Light My Fire' quite unmoving.\"\"Ray Manzarek, resplendent in a sweaty undershirt, contributed his usual pedestrian organ attempting throughout the show to deafen where he couldn’t excite.\"Linda Matthews, reviewing a show at Shrine Auditorium,  Dec. 23, 1967:“'Tedious' is the only way to describe the four-hour marathon of hard rock and psychedelia at the Shrine Exposition hall Saturday night.\"\"What they were waiting for was the Doors, who finally showed up at midnight and plodded routinely through half an hour of album cuts.\"\"The Doors, whose usually poetic improvisations are shaded with psycho-analytic overtone, were not at their best.\" ImagePete Johnson, reviewing a show at Hollywood Bowl, July 5, 1968:\"The Doors' concert at the Hollywood Bowl Friday night should have been an exciting event, the high point of the career of a local rock quartet whose struggle for success has taken more than two years. Instead it was a bore, the most disappointing pop concert at the Bowl since the Jefferson Airplane and an ill-mannered audience made a shambles of the place last summer.\"\"Again, the audience was largely to blame, but much of the fault lies with the Doors, particularly lead singer Jim Morrison, for failing to gain a rapport with the crowd.\"(Note: The Doors' July 5 date at the Bowl was released on record as “Live at the Hollywood Bowl” in 1987 and reissued in its entirety in 2012.)Tom Paegel, reviewing a show at Anaheim Convention Center, July 15, 1967:\"Morrison’s voice did not come over as well as it has in past performances. There was a note of hoarseness during several numbers. Words sometimes were inaudible and he seemed to be off-key. Their busy concert schedule may account for this, but the Doors are capable of doing better work.\"Robert Hilburn, reviewing a show at Long Beach Arena, Feb. 7, 1970:\"It took a long time Saturday night at the Long Beach Arena to get the Doors’ fire lighted. For the first hour they seemed far from the sensual, exciting, distinctive rock outfit they once were.\"\"But the Doors…seemed stale and unexciting.\" ImageDonna Chick, reviewing a show at the Forum, Dec. 14, 1968:\"'Light My Fire,' one of the songs everyone waited for, was a disappointment. The song dragged on so long that it failed to even vaguely resemble the original recording and instead sounded like a last-minute improvisation.\"\"Morrison seemed content to wallow in the pleasure of his own talent, the audience becoming hostile.\"\"The audience got something different – the amphibian prince began to recite his own poetry. The effect would have been better in a small smokey room filled with intimate friends. But the majority of the audience who had paid to see the 'Fantastic Door' was obviously disappointed. Applause and cheers were replaced by endless obscenities and irritable silence.\"\"Perhaps Morrison should give up performing, which seems to be an effort for him, and concentrate on reciting and writing poetry. He doesn’t need the bulky load of screaming girls to feed his ego – it’s already overweight.\" Image","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:01:54.720Z","datePublished":"2017-07-03T20:41:00.000Z","headline":"‘Tedious.’ ‘Stale.’ ‘Ugly croaks’: All the times L.A.

He purports that Tidal breached his contract, and his legal team declared an end to their deal several times despite efforts to reconcile, TMZ said. West, a Chicago-bred rapper, also contends that his 2016 album, \"The Life of Pablo,\" attracted 1.5 million new subscribers to the streaming service and that should have earned him a bonus. But Tidal reportedly hasn't paid up, nor did it reimburse him for music videos he made -- ones that he appears to be holding hostage until he gets the money he's owed.Incidentally, Jay-Z's new album, \"4:44,\" features a diss track trashing his \"Watch the Throne\" collaborator. However, according to TMZ, West's decision to sever ties predates that song and West had no knowledge of the lyrics before that. (Jay-Z's lyrics are said to be fueled by West's November 2016 concert rant in which he went after the Brooklyn rapper and his wife, Beyoncé.)Tidal reportedly insists that West still has an exclusive contract with the company, and if he tried to shop his wares to another service, it would sue him. West will allegedly counter-sue.Update, 1:15 p.m.: A previous version of this story included tweets from an unverified Twitter account.

Tolkien and Warner Bros. over whether Frodo, Gandalf and their pals can be used to push online gambling, among other assorted digital products, has come to an end. In 2012, the author's estate and publisher HarperCollins filed an $80 million lawsuit against Warner Bros., its New Line subsidiary and the Saul Zaentz Co., over merchandising rights granted in an initial 1969 agreement. Warner Bros. turned the \"Lord of the Rings\" books into a $5.8-billion global box-office giant.The deal struck nearly 50 years ago gave its licensees rights to use details from Tolkien's \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Hobbit\" novels to sell \"articles of tangible personal property,\" excluding books and printed published material. It did not, the estate and publisher argued in their initial filing, extend rights to market the world of Middle-earth beyond \"tangible\" goods.Enter: The Internet, social media, downloadable goods, apps and a whole new world of digital moneymaking.At the center of the 2012 beef were several intangible ways Warner Bros. was allegedly circumventing the restrictions of the agreement to milk the \"Lord of the Rings\" franchise digitally and online, via downloadable video games and particularly in the arena of online gambling.Lawyers for the estate identified an online slot game based on 2001's \"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\" and argued that the studio's additional licensing of the property for use in physical casino games harmed the legacy and reputation of Tolkien, who died in 1973.They also called out Warner Bros. for registering trademarks or intent to use applications to extend licensing to “hotels, restaurants, travel agencies, ringtones, online/downloadable games and housing developments.\"Attorneys for both parties gave no details of their settlement agreement in a June 29 filing but issued a joint statement declaring an end to the long-running lawsuit.\"The parties are pleased that they have amicably resolved this matter and look forward to working together in the future.\"","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:57:33.767Z","datePublished":"2017-07-03T19:32:00.000Z","headline":"Warner Bros., Tolkien estate end legal scuffle over  ‘Lord of the Rings’ merchandising","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/014f93b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+60/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2Fa4%2F0ab24cc47e9a0203cbbe2139650d%2Fla-clh1-ca-os-1106-rings5-o-1-20170703","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Jen Yamato"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-2017-htmlstory.html#warner-bros-tolkien-estate-end-legal-scuffle-over-lord-of-the-rings-merchandising"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageJohn Oliver and the folks at HBO's \"Last Week Tonight\" have some \"horrifying new friends,\" and in the spirit of Hollywood nepotism, they've promptly cast one of said pals in a movie. We're talking about President Warren G.
