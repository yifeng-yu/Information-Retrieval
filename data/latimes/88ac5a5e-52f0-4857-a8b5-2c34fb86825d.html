Lucas Spelman. The fire is burning over a large area that has created dramatically different firefighting conditions, he said.On the western side of the fire, closer to the ocean, high humidity on Monday held the moisture in the air and trapped the smoke, making visibility so bad that it grounded firefighting aircraft, Spelman said. On the eastern side, firefighters had had the “exact opposite thing going on,” with “exceptionally low” humidity, dry brush and fast-moving flames, Spelman said.“It’s almost like the mountains are just doused in gasoline,” said Spelman, who has worked on numerous major wildfires already this year. “The brush is just burning at a rate that’s incredible.”

But there is no one-size-fits-all approach.“It helps the firefighters,” he said, “but every fire is different.  There’s not a set ‘If this is happening, do this.’ It’s all up to the best judgment of the firefighters.”Aircraft are the biggest help in fighting a massive blaze like the Blue Cut fire, said Lanier. As the air attack crews explore the land from above, they broadcast the problem areas to field troops over the radio.“There is no premade map to say we’re going to protect this area first,” Lanier said. “It’s what they see on the ground and what they see in the air that determines whatever they can do to help to mitigate the firefight.”There is a common misconception that firefighters will protect the most expensive properties or biggest towns first, Lanier said, but that’s never the case.“Firefighters are blind to the cost,” he said. “The job is to go and save as much as possible.”The difficulties firefighters throughout the state face are compounded by drought conditions, he said. The drought leads to “beetle kill,” he said, referring to when beetles harvest and live on dry pine.The insects essentially infect the trees, leaving them bone-dry, ready to ignite.  Fire crews in the Cajon Pass have likely had difficulty assessing the damage and number of homes lost because of safety concerns and protocol that grants wildland firefighters the right of way over those who assess.“It can affect the wildland firefighting if there’s multiple vehicles out there,” Lanier said. “The engines have to get to the homes and get into the other areas. If multiple vehicles are there, it’s hard to get out.”Utility companies are not allowed on roads either, he added, because first responders want to keep the vehicle count on the roads low.Crews are likely now focused on perimeter control, Lanier said.“That’s always a very tough one when you’ve got very active winds and fuels that are extremely dry,” he said. “It’s been a long fire season.”","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:58:21.274Z","datePublished":"2016-08-18T19:29:00.000Z","headline":"No clear path to extinguishing Blue Cut fire, expert says","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6c2f9a2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1550x872+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F27%2F0f%2F087566109fb4fbd734eea155479d%2F1550x872","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-updates-wildfire-season-california-2016-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Sarah Parvini"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-updates-wildfire-season-california-2016-htmlstory.html#no-clear-path-to-extinguishing-blue-cut-fire-expert-says"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"While on patrol in Phelan looking to mop up spots fire, Beverly Hills firefighters paused to assist two dogs that appeared to suffer from smoke inhalation.The firefighters left two silver buckets for the dogs -- one with food and another with water.The dogs were eventually recovered by San Bernardino County animal control officers.

The Pomo Elementary fire was connected to Pashilk by GPS tracker, according to the document.Pashilk's activity appeared to subside after the summer, but picked up again last month, the document alleges.Fires began to spark up again in Clearlake, then farther south in Lower Lake, along Highway 29.At least a half-dozen fires started along the highway, not far from where the 4,000-acre Clayton fire ultimately ignited.On July 27, Pashilk allegedly attempted to start a fire near the Holiday Island mobile home park in Clearlake. A week-and-a-half later, GPS trackers put his vehicle near where a matchbook had started a small blaze in Lower Lake, though it burned itself out.

Adams gave several reasons: She has friends who are firefighters who are updating her on the blaze, and she wants to make sure homes belonging to the families who did evacuate aren't broken into, she said.But there was also another reason — all of the snowboards, skateboards, hats and clothing that belonged to her 17-year-old son who died in a solo car accident in March. \"I just needed more time to pack,\" she said. \"I just have to have his stuff.\"Adams moved to Wrightwood from Mission Viejo about 12-years ago. Her husband at the time worked for the Food and Drug Administration and had been given the choice of transferring to San Bernardino County or Fresno.\"It was this or Fresno and I'm not moving over there, so we moved here,\" she said.State and federal fire authorities have announced mandatory evacuations for all of Wrightwood, and sheriff's deputies went through the community late Tuesday night urging residents to leave. However, not all residents received a visit by authorities. Until that happens, Adams and others said they would stay put. An occupational therapist who manages the rehab department at Spring Valley Post Acute Care in Hesperia, Adams said she plans to leave the second she's told to evacuate or sees the fire getting worse.Standing nearby was her friend and neighbor, Asha Ramirez, 38, a realtor who said she'd do the same.\"I don't want to make the firefighters' job tougher than it already is,\" Ramirez said, snapping photos of the large smoke cloud.Ramirez, who has lived in the neighborhood for five years with her husband and three children, said she didn't leave because she wanted to wait as long as possible before she was forced to leave. She also didn't know exactly what to pack.\"I don't know how long we'll be gone,\" she said. \"Plus, once I go down the mountain, I can't come back.\"She said she trusts firefighters will do everything they can to keep their homes safe when she leaves. ","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:56:29.686Z","datePublished":"2016-08-17T19:21:00.000Z","headline":"Wrightwood evacuation holdouts explain why they won’t leave","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-updates-wildfire-season-california-2016-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Ruben Vives"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-updates-wildfire-season-california-2016-htmlstory.html#wrightwood-evacuation-holdouts-explain-why-they-wont-leave"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Tweet","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:57:06.123Z","datePublished":"2016-08-17T19:16:00.000Z","headline":"WATCH: Firefighting helicopter scoops water from lake to fight Blue Cut fire","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-updates-wildfire-season-california-2016-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Angel Jennings"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-updates-wildfire-season-california-2016-htmlstory.html#watch-firefighting-helicopter-scoops-water-from-lake-to-fight-blue-cut-fire"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"TweetRoss Hansen lashed a blue duffel bag to the roof of his black SUV as flames crept slowly down a mountainside about two miles from his home Wednesday. Although Ross and his wife Lisa were defying mandatory evacuation orders, they wanted to be ready to flee if they had to. The Wrightwood couple said they have evacuated twice before in the past -- mostly because their children were home.What they say they learned those two experiences though is that they never really had to leave their home to begin with. Nothing burned and firefighters proved to have an excellent track record of protecting the neighborhood.\"This time we just decided to see what happens,\" he said.The wind was relatively calm as Hansen explained himself Wednesday, and there were no drifting embers creating hot spots ahead of the fire.

It can go from real slow burning to extreme burning in a heartbeat,” he said.Three firefighters were treated and released for smoke inhalation.Wakoski said in his 40-year career fighting fires, he never has seen anything like this. “We are not even in the hot part of fire season yet,” he said.  “This is October-like fire behavior conditions we're having right now, and we’re only in August, so we are in for a fight.”Read More","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:57:21.837Z","datePublished":"2016-08-17T18:24:00.000Z","headline":"‘We got our butts kicked’: Fire officials recount explosive growth of Blue Cut blaze","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3eca3dc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1400x788+0+84/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F23%2F39%2F8698dd124b2cb35a3cd1aa552866%2Fla-lb-media-leyva-20181203-152951","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-updates-wildfire-season-california-2016-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Angel Jennings"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-updates-wildfire-season-california-2016-htmlstory.html#we-got-our-butts-kicked-fire-officials-recount-explosive-growth-of-blue-cut-blaze"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"TweetMary Grass and her husband evacuated their home just above Highway 138 around 2 p.m. Tuesday.The couple grabbed their horse, dropped it off at a friend’s house in Hesperia and spent the night in Victorville.   “Just wondering about our house now,” Grass, 74, said.Grass said TV footage of the area showed homes near her neighborhood had burned down.

Here is some background from The Times archives. What are fire tornadoes?Known in the science community as a fire whirl, on social media they've become popularly known as a fire tornado or \"firenado.\" In fact, the phenomenon has been documented, and feared, for more than 100 years, according to a 2012 article in the Journal of Combustion. TweetWhat do we know about them?A fire whirl can occur when trees, a hillside or even a wall of flames forces air to shift or rotate among competing air temperatures and speeds -- and eventually it tilts the rotating air from a horizontal position to a vertical one, giving it the tornado-like appearance.Some fire whirls dissipate moments after starting because the heat and air flow that maintained them ventilate out. But others can travel and sustain themselves as the heat is lifted on buoyant air, and gas surrounding the whirl pushes it tighter into itself, making it more intense. The air inside the funnel can then act as a compressed, rotating column of gas, according to the study.Scientists estimate fire whirls burn fuel three to seven times faster than an open flame.  Tweet","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:47:32.357Z","datePublished":"2016-08-17T16:49:00.000Z","headline":"Dramatic ‘fire tornadoes’ show intensity of devastating Blue Cut fire","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-updates-wildfire-season-california-2016-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Veronica Rocha"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Joseph Serna"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-updates-wildfire-season-california-2016-htmlstory.html#dramatic-fire-tornadoes-show-intensity-of-devastating-blue-cut-fire"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageSee more from the gallery >","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:47:36.268Z","datePublished":"2016-08-17T16:40:00.000Z","headline":"Hot spot in Phelan","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0987b0d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3d%2F8b%2F10b3edeb2b834698439aa44813f1%2Fla-me-blue-cut-fire-photos-20160816-032","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-updates-wildfire-season-california-2016-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Irfan Khan"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-updates-wildfire-season-california-2016-htmlstory.html#hot-spot-in-phelan"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"TweetEarly Wednesday morning, Captain Howard Deets and the Mill Creek hotshots sat near Cajon Boulevard, monitoring the battle against a blaze that was consuming a hill nearby.Crews on the ground cleared brush and laid hoses as flames flared along the ridge.A perfect mix of circumstances had combined to create the fast-moving Blue Cut fire, Deets said.It's been 13 years since a large fire in this area left the hills and mountains covered in old, dead brush intermixed with new growth.Then, on Tuesday, the wind moved in just the right way to get the fire going.\"It all aligned.

However, many residents fled in the face of a  fierce, wind-driven blaze about two miles to the southeast.On Wednesday morning, nervous holdouts gathered at local gas stations to share information gleaned from the latest news reports, and from telephone conversations with neighbors along  rideglines who had clear views of the fire's progress. There was little cause for optimism as erratic winds raked the limbs of Jefferson pines, and as firefighters and San Bernardino County Sheriff’s  positioned themselves along narrow streets lined with A-frame homes and log cabins.“A fireman who came into my store this morning bought lots of Gatorade and a muffin – then shook his head and said, ‘Gonna be a bad day today,’” recalled Patrick Boyle, 52, owner of Wrightwood Market.“That prompted a customer  to ask, ‘So, is our town going to burn down?’ “ Boyle added. “The fireman responded, ‘I wouldn’t go that far.’ “The edgy mood was similar to one that blanketed the community in 2009, when flames propelled by winds swept to within a quarter-mile of homes in the town that straddles Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties.Nodding toward a nearby group of deputies chit-chatting and sipping coffee, Michele Lesle, 65,  mused, “As long as those fellows don’t panic, I won’t.”“But if they all of a sudden look worried, I’m packed and ready to scoot,” added Lesle, a 35-year Wrightwood resident.Like many other holdouts, Lesle made frequent calls to neighbors closer to the fire.“I called a friend at 6 a.m. and asked, ‘what do you see out there?’ “ she said. “My neighbor said, ‘Lots of smoke, but no flames.”When Lesle called again an hour later, the neighbor’s report was a less threatening, “Hazy.”But Lesle was not about to let her guard down.Gazing up at tree tops wobbling in the wind, she said, “Just hope embers don’t land in those pines.”","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:47:53.203Z","datePublished":"2016-08-17T16:08:00.000Z","headline":"As fire creeps toward Wrightwood, some residents refuse to evacuate","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4e2ad2a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff1%2F2f%2Fb4935b838b9086ca9dd473428578%2Fimg-5c00225f-turbine-la-lb-media-3026109-en-oscar-roundtable-lead-actors-kdm-0534-20181129-093104","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-updates-wildfire-season-california-2016-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Louis Sahagun"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-updates-wildfire-season-california-2016-htmlstory.html#as-fire-creeps-toward-wrightwood-some-residents-refuse-to-evacuate"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThere is little weather relief in sight for firefighters battling the Blue Cut fire, the National Weather Service said Wednesday.  “At least for the next couple of days, it’s going to be very, very dry,” said Philip Gonsalves, a meteorologist with the weather service in San Diego. “That’s the conditions that will affect the fire more than anything else. It’s going to be hot, very dry and windy in the afternoons.”  Gonsalves said the weather service has been in touch with the firefighting agencies and responders in the Cajon Pass region where the fire was raging. One major concern, he said, is that there is an abundance of fuel in the area where the fire began.Vegetation in the area hasn’t burned in a very long time, Gonsalves added, making it vulnerable to wildfires.Highs will reach the 90s during the day. The winds should drop off at night, the weather service said, but it will still be dry.“They won’t get much in the sense of humidity recovery in the nighttime hours,” Gonsalves said. “If there’s a fire in a location where there’s good humidity recovery overnight, it helps the firefighters to get a handle on the fire.

About an hour later, they were parked a few miles down the road at a ranger station, waiting to be sure an elderly neighbor also made it down.Pomella sat in her Prius, which was packed with pillows, blankets and clothes. A cat rested in its carrier. Her husband was parked in an SUV behind her, with the couples' three dogs. They've lived in the area for 25 years and have had to evacuate before so they were well prepared and unsurprised by how fast the fire was moving, she said. \"It's part of living in this canyon,\" she said. \"It went fast. But it's very dry.\" Pomella has volunteered to help with fire preparedness in her community and said she and her neighbors have worked to ensure that their properties are cleared of brush and anything else that could make them more flammable. \"People need to be prepared and just know that that's part of the risk of living in these kinds of areas,\" she said. \"We've got a beautiful community.\"Further up the road at an RV park where deputies were knocking on doors and asking people to leave, Emilio, who gave his first name only, said he had his things packed and ready to go but would wait to see how the fire progressed. \"They're doing an amazing job,\" he said of the deputies and fire fighters in the area. \"They're fighting hard for Lytle Creek right now.\"Not far away Joe Gonzales, who has lived in his Lytle Creek Canyon home for six years now, said deputies had come by a few minutes earlier and old him to leave. He grabbed laptops and important papers and was ready to go, but was waiting first to hear from deputies whether an elderly neighbor would need a ride before evacuating himself. \"I'm a little worried. I don't want to leave here.
