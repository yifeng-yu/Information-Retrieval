<p>One topic that he just can't quit is California. Trump, who lost the state by more than 4 million votes in 2016, is returning Tuesday to raise money for his reelection campaign from supporters in San Francisco, San Diego and Beverly Hills.</p>

<p>To mark the occasion, The Times compiled everything the president has tweeted about the Golden State, its policies and politicians.</p>

            <p>The president is quick to fault the state's liberal politicians, including Gavin Newsom, Jerry Brown and Rep. Adam Schiff. But it's clear that no one draws Trump's ire like Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who is the subject of nearly half of his California-related tweets.</p>

This should be a vote on the filthy language, statements and lies told by the Democrat...Congresswomen, who I truly believe, based on their actions, hate our Country.

Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how...it is done.

Weak, ineffective & stupid are not exactly the qualities that Republicans, or the CITIZENS of our Country, were looking for.
