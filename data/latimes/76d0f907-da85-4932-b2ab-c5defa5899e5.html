McCaleb said that volunteering has been a welcome distraction from the looming fire.\"It's not like someone-pointing-a-gun-at-you scared,\" said McCaleb, who used to work in Army intelligence. \"Its more of a controlled fright where you know whats happening.\"He hasn't slept much in the last week, he said. His voice is gravelly from days of exposure to increasingly unhealthy air brought on by a series of wildfires that have torn across Southern California since Dec. 4.He and much of the Montecito community, he said, have been checking websites daily for the latest on the fire. Not just official sources like Cal Fire or the Santa Barbara County website, but any webpage that claims to have the latest details on how the fire is behaving.McCaleb was up at 3 a.m. Monday, checking his computer for the latest on the Thomas fire, which has burned 230,500 acres since it started in Ventura County a week ago. The fire spread into Santa Barbara County over the weekend and is quickly approaching Montecito, officials said.McCaleb and his wife were chased out of their weekend home in the Ojai Valley on Wednesday as Santa Ana winds pushed the fire north.Their two-acre property there is protected by a wide brush clearance and a field recently plowed beween their homes and the hills.  Their biggest concern right now is how their koi pond is faring with all the ash. ","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:03:08.147Z","datePublished":"2017-12-11T22:38:00.000Z","headline":"For some, Thomas fire triggers ‘controlled fright’","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Joseph Serna"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#for-some-thomas-fire-triggers-controlled-fright"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageMontecito looked almost like a ghost town Monday.Stores and gas stations in the evacuation zone north of Highway 192 were closed, and only a scattering of residents remained in the neighborhood.California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Fresno-Kings Battalion Chief Roger Raines and his platoon of more than a dozen trucks and water tenders were on hand however. It was their job to assess how vulnerable homes north of the highway between San Ysidro Road and Park Lane were to the incoming fire.Raines' defense zone includes about 50 multimillion-dollar estates connected by a tangle of narrow, winding tree-lined roads barely wide enough for the trucks assigned to protect them.On Monday afternoon he sat in his truck at the intersection of Park Lane and East Mountain Drive, just outside the open field his team designated a safety zone  — a place they could regroup if things took a turn for the worse.\"This is our first shift here, but we've been running for a week,\" Raines said. \"We were at the Skirball, then were sent to Riverside and now here.\"With the 230,500-acre Thomas fire still miles to the east, firefighters in Montecito were going door to door Monday to see who did or did not evacuate, which homes had water sources, which had good clearance between their property and the forest and if the home appeared to be defendable should the Thomas fire bear down on the community.Raines said many of the homes in his zone looked defendable, with tile roofs and gravel landscaping. But, he clarified, that doesn't mean they're guaranteed to be safe if powerful sundowner winds blast the flames down onto the area.Gusty winds pushed the fire seven miles west overnight, he said, and by Monday afternoon ash was falling in the Montecito community. The sky was a grey haze, and the acrid air stings the back of the throat.The crews assigned to protect the foothill homes Monday evening will be on patrol for any embers that can spark a fire, Raines said.The Thomas fire isn't the worst Raines has seen — he was up in Napa County just two months ago for the wine country fires — but it was unusual.\"It’s December,” he said. “This doesn't happen in December.\"","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:47:25.399Z","datePublished":"2017-12-11T21:24:00.000Z","headline":"Firefighters ready to protect homes in Montecito should the Thomas fire bear down","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d458c2a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F23%2F46%2F26d469abba039387fce29445a141%2Fla-lb-media-20171211-121327-20171211-134152","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Joseph Serna"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#firefighters-ready-to-protect-homes-in-montecito-should-the-thomas-fire-bear-down"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"The quaint eateries, coffee shops and wine shops along Lillie Drive in Summerland were closed or empty Monday as ash fell on the quiet beach town in Santa Barbara County.

That’s where they set up defensive positions and waited just in case the fire moved downhill .\"The terrain ... makes it super difficult for us to position with normal tactics,\" said Kalin Ramirez, a fire information officer.While crews stage in town to protect homes, a fleet of fixed wing aircraft will attack flames higher up in the mountains and try to douse the fire directly, Ramirez said.The Thomas fire has burned 230,500 acres and was 15% contained Monday morning. None of that containment, however, appears to be on the blaze's western face approaching Santa Barbara.A rare feature of California's landscape, the Santa Barbara and Carpinteria communities sit in the shadow of an east-west mountain range that is allowing the flames to run west along its spine, as dry, powerful Santa Ana winds push the blaze.\"We look for rivers, roads and ridges\" to set up defenses, Ramirez said. At night when the air cools, the mass of smoke and ash that were launched skyward by the heat of wildfire can collapse on itself. This creates an outward push of wind and heat out in all directions, further driving the fire, Ramirez said.Some of the newly burned areas have been turned into a moonscape, Ramirez said.

Almost immediately, the dry, gusty Santa Ana winds carried the flames west across the nearby Rancho Monserate community in Fallbrook and into the mostly rural area of the San Luis Rey River valley.Not everyone was as fortunate as Knapp.Read more here.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:52:27.024Z","datePublished":"2017-12-10T14:57:00.000Z","headline":"San Diego County’s Lilac fire devastates retirement community","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Phil Diehl"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#san-diego-countys-lilac-fire-devastates-retirement-community"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Evacuations were ordered in parts of Carpinteria and Montecito as the Thomas fire moved into Santa Barbara County’s southern coast.The Santa Barbara County Fire Department said at least one home was burned.  Tweet Tweet Tweet","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:52:31.912Z","datePublished":"2017-12-10T14:52:00.000Z","headline":"Evacuations in Carpinteria, Montecito","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#evacuations-in-carpinteria-montecito"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"A brush fire that ignited in Monrovia on Saturday night prompted evacuations of residents along Norumbega Dr. and a large group of Boy Scouts.Initial reports suggest the fire broke out near the foothills of the Angeles National Forest, north of the 210 freeway.

Their dogs have assisted in search and rescue missions at ground zero after 9/11, the Haiti earthquake in 2010 and most recently in Houston after Hurricane Harvey. On Monday, the Thomas fire swept through their 125-acre property, burning parts of the area where they train dogs. Around eight staff members helped evacuate the nearly 20 dogs on the property. Since then, the animals, along with Heritage and other staff, have been staying at the Marriott Hotel in downtown Ventura, where they care for the dogs. On Saturday, Heritage was playing with one of the canines — a 2-year-old black German shepherd named Zeek. She tried to yank the ball away from him, but his grip was too tight. “He’s my heart,” Heritage said. “He reminds me of my dog who died last year.” All the dogs staying at the Marriott Hotel are being trained to find people buried under rubble, she said. “These dogs love toys, so we use that as part of training,” Heritage said. Although the hotel is not an ideal place to house dogs, Heritage is using the displacement as an opportunity to help the animals get acquainted with a different environment.“It’s good that they’re around so many people,” she said. “We walk them up and down the stairs and throughout the hotel at least eight times a day.” But she looks forward to returning to Santa Paula and rebuilding parts of the property that were damaged.  “We hope to return in a few days,” she said.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:02:19.979Z","datePublished":"2017-12-09T17:40:00.000Z","headline":"Dogs trained for disaster relief were displaced by the Thomas fire.

Using established scientific methods and often a series of small flags to track a fire’s course, investigators can usually determine a fire’s origin quickly and within a few feet.“Especially in a wind-driven fire, it’s going to travel in a cone,” said Escondido Fire Department spokesman Dominic Polito.Read more here.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:47:43.215Z","datePublished":"2017-12-09T16:13:00.000Z","headline":"Investigators probe cause of San Diego County wildfire","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"J.

Firefighters continued to encounter difficulty on the east side of the fire above Fillmore.Firefighters used helicopters to drop water in that area to try to contain the blaze. Firefighters also made progress on Highway 33 and U.S. 101 on the west side of the fire. They said activity in that area has decreased from previous days.Tim Chavez, a fire behavior analyst for Cal Fire, said in previous days firefighters were contending with blazes that were driven by the wind.On Friday, Chavez said, they were battling fuel-driven fires. “Today’s fire moved slower but with higher intensity, but only in places with heavy fuels,” Chavez said. Officials at Friday’s news conference estimate the cost of the Thomas fire to be at least $17 million and said that more than 4,000 firefighters are engaged. ","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:02:25.041Z","datePublished":"2017-12-09T03:07:00.000Z","headline":"Authorities report progress on Thomas fire; some evacuation orders lifted","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Melissa Etehad"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#authorities-report-progress-on-thomas-fire-some-evacuation-orders-lifted"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"The Thomas fire, which has burned hundreds of homes in Ventura County, has consumed 143,000 acres, officials said Friday evening.The fire is 10% contained, and officials said firefighters made solid progress Friday as Santa Ana winds weakened.Many evacuations remain in effect.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:58:22.040Z","datePublished":"2017-12-09T02:29:00.000Z","headline":"Thomas fire grows to 143,000 acres, 10% contained","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#thomas-fire-grows-to-143-000-acres-10-contained"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Officials on Friday said the Skirball fire burning in Bel-Air is now 50% contained.The mayor’s office said evacuation orders remain in place for residents on two stretches of Linda Flora Drive and a stretch of Moraga Drive.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:52:31.393Z","datePublished":"2017-12-09T02:27:00.000Z","headline":"Skirball fire in Bel-Air is 50% contained","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#skirball-fire-in-bel-air-is-50-contained"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"San Diego County’s much-vaunted emergency communications system was unavailable for a multitude of callers as a runaway wildfire raced across northern San Diego County most of Thursday.Caller after caller could not connect with a live person for fire information or directions about where to evacuate the Lilac fire.“I got a recording from Verizon that said the line was disconnected,” said Edward Collins, a retired airline marketing professional who was watching the fire from the backyard of his San Marcos home.“I assumed it was going to say the area’s under mandatory evacuation and which areas should be concerned, but all I got was a non-working number,” Collins added. “I called several times, and my wife called also.

There was not time to do anything else.”Barns, she noted, tend to be full of flammable material that makes keeping up with a wind-driven blaze more difficult.As dozens, then hundreds of horses were turned out of their stalls, trainers and other personnel tried frantically to get them under control. Eventually, most calmed down enough to be loaded onto trailers destined for the stables at Del Mar Fairgrounds. But there was a time there in the middle of the action where it seemed like many of the horses would never stop moving long enough to be coaxed in the right direction.With visibility very low, and thousand-pound animals moving in often-random directions, trampling was a very real possibility. But that did not appear to have happened Thursday afternoon. A Downs employee who declined to give his name said he was unaware of any cases where people were run down.The horses were not so lucky.Trainer Brian Kozak said he saw several had collapsed on the track and more died in the barns.“There’s a lot of dead horses,” he said. “A lot of them just didn’t get out of their stalls and got asphyxiated.”Read more here.

McBride, who works at the Del Mar race track, said some horses were evacuated to the nearby track where many compete.“There was so much smoke it was difficult to see,” said horse trainer Dan Durham, who got his 20 horses rounded up and was loading them into vans to be evacuated. “Some of the horses were turned loose so they could be safe. They were scattered around.”San Luis Rey Downs is home to horses that run at nearby Del Mar and other top-flight California tracks like Santa Anita Park. Doug O’Neill, whose horses have won the Kentucky Derby and Breeders’ Cup races, is among the trainers who keep at least part of their stable there.The sign at the front calls it “Home of Azeri,” the now-retired mare who was the 2002 U.S. Horse of the Year who earned more than $4 million in her career.Horse trainer Scott Hansen said he knows some of the 30 horses he had at the facility were killed.“I don’t know how many are living and how many are dead,” Hansen said. “I guess I’ll have to figure that out in the morning.” For now, he said he was concentrating on getting his horses that survived to evacuation centers.Another trainer, Cliff Sise, told KFMB-TV that he saw about 10 horses die, including his own filly.“It was dark, everything was hot, and she wouldn’t come out. I opened the pen and tried to get behind her and get her out, and she wouldn’t get out,” Sise said. “She burned to death that quick.”","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:01:14.170Z","datePublished":"2017-12-08T04:45:00.000Z","headline":"Elite thoroughbred race horses killed in San Diego wildfires","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5412e30/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1942x1092+0+159/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2Fa1%2Fd389125b6b5cf391c7bfa65dcf28%2Fla-lb-media-apphoto-californiawildfires-20171208-085428","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#elite-thoroughbred-race-horses-killed-in-san-diego-wildfires"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"As firefighters made progress on the Creek fire, officials announced most residents will be allowed to return to their homes as of 4 p.m. Thursday.The Riverwood, Ebey Canyon and Doane Canyon areas are open to residents only, as is the Shadow Hills area north of Sunland Boulevard, the Los Angeles Fire Department posted on Twitter. Limekiln Canyon remains closed from Pacoima Canyon Road to Maclay Street.Skirball fire evacuees — including those who live on Roscomare Road, Bel Terrace, all roads between Sunset Boulevard and Bellagio Road, and North Casiano Road from Mulholland Drive — can return home at 8 p.m. Thursday. As of 7 a.m. Thursday, the following evacuation zones for other Southern California fires are still in place: Thomas fire (Ventura County)Ventura Avenue from Canada Larga to Foster RoadCreek Road at Ventura StreetCreek Road north to Camp ComfortVentura Street north to MontgomeryCreek Road south of Camp ComfortPersimmon HillNorweign TrackCasitas SpringsFoster ParkIn Santa Paula, everything east of Highway 150 from Say Road to the northern city limitsThe area east of Santa Paula and north of Highway 126, including Timber Canyon Road, Toland Road and Hall RoadHighway 150 west of Peck and north of Virginia TerraceFoothill, Telegraph and Ashwood HillCounty Inn Estates mobile home park at Wells and TelegraphEncino RoadAlto RoadFeliz RoadLilac fire (San Diego County)From West Lilac Road to Sullivan Middle SchoolSouth of Burma RoadEast of Wilshire, north of North River Road West of South Mission AvenueNorth of Pala Road South of Reche Road West of Interstate 15East of Green Canyon RoadWest Mission Road","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:56:44.631Z","datePublished":"2017-12-08T01:38:00.000Z","headline":"Most residents displaced by Creek and Skirball fires will be allowed to go home","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Alejandra Reyes-Velarde"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#most-residents-displaced-by-creek-and-skirball-fires-will-be-allowed-to-go-home"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Los Angeles Unified school officials are opening several centers where students affected by wildfires can pick up free meals. Meals will be available between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. on Friday and Saturday at the following locations: Byrd Middle School, 8501 Arleta Ave. in Sun Valley Reseda High School, 18230 Kittridge St. in ResedaPalms Middle School, 10860 Woodbine St. in Los Angeles","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:47:41.563Z","datePublished":"2017-12-08T01:31:00.000Z","headline":"L.A.

With an estimated population of 60, and just one way in and out, Matilija Canyon has a reputation as a haven for fiercely independent mountain folk and survivalists.By the time fire engines were rumbling up Highway 33, Kaufman watched as billowing clouds of red, orange and gray smoke rose from ridges on both sides of Ecotopia, a patchwork of sunflowers, vegetables and wildflowers he has managed for two years.“It’s looking pretty bad out there,” he said. “But it’s still not time to leave.”","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:49:45.242Z","datePublished":"2017-12-07T21:18:00.000Z","headline":"Near Ojai, concern about the canyon dwellers who stayed behind","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e3b451e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/320x180+0+30/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa0%2Ffb%2F77b39b41ee12acb85a7063bddd30%2Fimg-5a29ba04-turbine-la-lb-media-img-4079-20171207-140033","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Louis Sahagun"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#near-ojai-concern-about-the-canyon-dwellers-who-stayed-behind"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageVentura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen said if the wind continues, and rain doesn’t touch the region, the Thomas fire could continue for a few more weeks. “Until the wind stops blowing, there’s really not a lot we can do as far as controlling the perimeter, so our opportunities are hopefully going to come in tomorrow as the wind lets up,” Lorenzen said. Then, he said, the firefighters can place line around the blaze and contain part of it, but “this is a fight we’re going to be fighting probably for a couple of weeks.”While there was once such a thing as a predictable wildfire season, Lorenzen said that season now seems to last all year — a shift, he said, potentially triggered by six years of drought and climate change.At last count, the Thomas fire had consumed 96,000 acres, but as the fire expanded around Ojai and into the Los Padres National Forest in Santa Barbara County, that acreage will likely grow.Fire in the forest area, Lorenzen said, presents new challenges: The dryness provides ample fuel for the fire to spread.“There’s no road out there, and the wind is pushing it,” Lorenzen said. “You can’t put anybody out in front of it.”This week, the fire destroyed an undetermined number of homes in Ojai.“My hope is that within a week, the issues around the population areas are going to be gone, but then it’s still going to be up in the forest in the wilderness areas, and it’s a challenge,” Lorenzen said. “It’s hard to get [there]. The size and the scope of this thing is going to be enormous.” Lorenzen said the public seems more apt to follow mandatory evacuation orders after the Santa Rosa fires.  “We are being really, really proactive about evacuating in advance of the fire,” Lorenzen said. “So just tell people to be prepared. Be ready to go, and when the time comes, just leave.”","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:52:58.975Z","datePublished":"2017-12-07T20:59:00.000Z","headline":"The ‘enormous’ Thomas fire could burn for a few more weeks, fire chief says","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9ebb862/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1100x619+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F37%2Fb6%2F29bafbc22f91ee273ff77d0c9293%2F1100x619","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Jaclyn Cosgrove"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#the-enormous-thomas-fire-could-burn-for-a-few-more-weeks-fire-chief-says"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageAlicia Stratton stood alongside railroad tracks in Faria Beach and watched the flames burn a few hundred feet away. She had evacuated her home about 30 minutes earlier. Stratton, 58, lives in Oak View, but her family has a vacation home in Faria Beach.“This fire kept migrating,” she said. “As soon as the wind picked up, I started to worry.” Her neighbor, Charlie McDowell, was eating lunch when the fire picked up momentum in the seaside community. “It was right in front of us,” he said, a mask and goggles covering his face. “It’s creeping.”A few minutes later, firefighters and sheriff’s deputies asked residents along the road to move themselves and their cars away from the fire line. The flames were growing closer and the thick smoke made it hard to see. Both said they were “very concerned” about the fate of their neighborhood. “It’s an amazing community,” McDowell, 34, said. “I was in L.A. last night and I got a call from neighbors saying they were watering my house.”Ventura County Fire Department spokesman Rich Macklin said firefighters are concerned that the Thomas fire will push into Santa Barbara County and threaten the city of Carpinteria. “We’re going to start moving with it,” he said, adding that about 2,000 firefighters are battling the blaze. Crews are concerned about erratic winds near the shore, which are reaching 30 to 40 mph, he said, with gusts of 45 to 50 mph. As he spoke, plumes of smoke shifted toward the ocean, obscuring visibility so badly that it was difficult to see a few hundred feet ahead. Distant booms could be heard in the distance — sounds Macklin attributed to “a tank of something releasing.” “Here, we had the fire burning toward about 70 to 80 homes,” he said. “We have six strike teams engines in there.” The fire in Faria Beach has been knocked down, he said. Aside from the wind, crews faced serious visibility problems and were handling the additional concern of residents who waited until the last minute to leave.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:57:39.040Z","datePublished":"2017-12-07T20:34:00.000Z","headline":"As Faria Beach residents assess the danger, firefighters follow Thomas fire toward Santa Barbara County","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b707311/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1100x619+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa9%2F1c%2F7d605d3ccc9278e89f4918a489f3%2F1100x619","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Sarah Parvini"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#as-faria-beach-residents-assess-the-danger-firefighters-follow-thomas-fire-toward-santa-barbara-county"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageCourtney Horrow isn’t taking any chances.  She is taking her two daughters, ages 4 and 6, to Palm Desert — away from the growing winds that for days have filled the skies with smoke and ash and now threaten her home, which sits up a hill on a windy street on North Bundy Drive and Chalon Road in Brentwood.She didn’t plan on returning to her white-wooded house until Sunday.

Thursday afternoon, firefighters will face bone-dry air with a relative humidity of 4%, and 33 mph winds out of the northeast that could push the fire toward the 405.The 20% containment figure means firefighters have cleared brush to make a fire break, or hauled in hoses, to stop the blaze from advancing along about one-fifth of the fire’s perimeter. “We’re not done,” said Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Ralph Terrazas. “We’re in the middle of this event.” One firefighter was injured early Wednesday and is receiving treatment for burns on his neck, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said.The LAFD plans to test a new technology Thursday: a drone that can use thermal imaging to seek out hot spots, a high-tech way of directing crews to areas that need attention. The drone also will assess property damage, Terrazas said. Officials used drones while battling fires in Northern California in October.The Skirball fire has destroyed four houses on Casiano Road, Moraga Drive and Linda Flora Drive, and damaged a dozen others.The wildfires raging across Southern California, stoked by winds as strong as 80 mph, have left fire departments stretched thin. Nearly 1,000 local agencies have sent firefighters to help battle the fires across Southern California, said Cal Fire’s Ken Pimlott. State officials also have asked strike teams from Montana, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico and Nevada to come to California, said Mark Ghilarducci, the director of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services.“Just two months ago, the city of Los Angeles had their firefighters up in Northern California fighting fires,” Ghilarducci said. “Now we’ve got Northern California firefighters here on this incident. Neighbor helping neighbor, everybody is supporting each other.”Officials urged residents to be patient and told those who have lingered behind to leave their homes and trust firefighters to protect them. L.A. Councilman Paul Koretz, whose district includes Bel-Air, scolded construction companies who sent their workers into the evacuation zone Thursday.“If you are a developer in the fire zone in Bel-Air, get the hell out and don’t come back until the evacuation is over,” Koretz said. He told The Times he was concerned that the trucks and equipment could block firetruck access and potentially spark new fires.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:52:30.974Z","datePublished":"2017-12-07T20:15:00.000Z","headline":"Firefighters gain toehold, contain 20% of Skirball fire by Thursday afternoon","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/028a561/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1100x619+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7a%2Feb%2F7e2a76e9dbb2a21581a0ecb64083%2F1100x619","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Laura J.

Atty. Michael Bradbury, walked into the Ojai police station Thursday, frustrated after days of living out of his car and monitoring the shifting Thomas fire.Bradbury, wearing aviator glasses as he leaned on his cane, said he had fled to the Ventura County Fairgrounds earlier this week with about half of his horses — he sits on the fairgrounds board, after all — but wanted to return to his ranch in Ojai. The retired D.A., who held the position for more than two decades, just didn’t know where the fire was or whether the threat was still real.City Manager Steve McClary sympathized with Bradbury’s frustration. “The problem with giving specifics of the fire: It could change in five minutes,” McClary said. Bradbury said he understood, but later asked to speak to Police Chief James Fryhoff. The former D.A. asked the chief how the deputies were faring and pressed for details about when he may return.“I would give it at least another day,” Fryhoff told Bradbury.The city of Ojai has been largely spared structural damage from the fire, but some homes along Highway 33 north of the city limit have been leveled.On Thursday, the sky south of Ojai was relatively clear and blue. To the north, where fire burned Wednesday night along the mountain ridge, the sky was gray and smoky. Some at the city’s evacuation shelter at Nordhoff High School were growing restless as the days dragged on. Fryhoff acknowledged the cabin fever. But, he cautioned, the lull in the firefight Thursday morning — when some residents who had been evacuated had returned to their homes to see blackened hillsides but less damage than they feared — did not mean the coast was clear. Thursday night and Friday could bring more treacherous conditions.“We’re all waiting for a wind event that we’re told is going to come,” Fryhoff said. “If we do get that, the fire could be unpredictable.” Mandatory evacuation orders remain in effect for those north of Grand Avenue, and some sheriff’s deputies drove through the hilly neighborhood on Thursday, urging residents to heed the order despite the apparent calm. “Hang back. We mean it,” Fryhoff said.McClary said that once the risk abates, residents in the Ojai Valley will be told when they can return.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:51:24.906Z","datePublished":"2017-12-07T19:37:00.000Z","headline":"Despite lull, a reminder that evacuation orders are still in effect in Ojai","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f633ca8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F23%2Fda%2Fad38ac570199ee45b742db47c86e%2F1600x900","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Matt Hamilton"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#despite-lull-a-reminder-that-evacuation-orders-are-still-in-effect-in-ojai"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"TweetFirefighters battled growing, ferocious winds across the street from homes along the edge of Faria Beach in Ventura late Thursday morning.The gusts kicked up flames on nearby palm trees and dry bushes. A police car drove up and down the road with a megaphone blaring: “mandatory evacuation” and “please go the other way, the road is closed.”The winds were so intense that the trees lit like matchsticks.

Many of the tallest flames have been knocked down. Some active fires are still burning, Hogan said, “but nothing that is raging and roaring.” Some deep canyons have decades of heavy brush growth that is highly flammable and is burning off, Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman David Ortiz said. Those areas are smoldering with embers that firefighters call “cat eyes,” because they glint in the darkness with a certain feline quality. Some canyons have 70-degree inclines, too steep to accommodate firefighters at all. Fire crews are dropping water on those areas with one airplane, with another on the way, LAFD spokesman Peter Sanders said.If the firefight goes well Thursday, with winds of 20 to 25 mph, officials may consider allowing some evacuated residents to temporarily return home to pick up clothes and medication, Hogan said.“What we don’t want to do is pull the trigger prematurely,” Hogan said.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:56:48.972Z","datePublished":"2017-12-07T17:38:00.000Z","headline":"Bel-Air firefighters faced 40-mph winds overnight","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/10c22e1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+104/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8a%2Fff%2F4ea806b1e9f98f79b71751b2ea63%2Fla-lb-media-3029601-me-1207-socal-fire-012-gem-20171207-095606","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Laura J.

While the abandoned structure just to the left of his home burned down, his house was safe.Varela, 67, was at dinner with friends Wednesday night when he heard about the fire nearing La Conchita. All five of the friends he was with had lost their homes in Ventura.Around 9 p.m., he made his way back to the neighborhood where he’s lived for 35 years. The police arrived shortly after and urged everyone to evacuate. But Varela stayed. He snuck into his brown house, grabbed a hose and started to water the balcony and roof, and douse any embers that flared up.The flames, he said, sounded like a train going through the area.“It was the most eerie thing,” he said. “And then the flames just came down.”Varela said he was impressed with the firefighters, who quickly found a way to get water up the hill when the hydrant wasn’t working. They attached a hose to the base of the road and took a hose 100 feet up toward his home.“It’s a relief,” he said. “I think tonight I’m gonna sleep really good.”He called this neighborhood his “slice of paradise” and said he plans on staying here to ensure no flare-up burns his home.“I’m going to be happy, at least for the day,” Varela said.His wife, who spent the night at their office in Ventura, was worried that he stayed behind.When he called her at 5 a.m. to tell her their house was OK, she cried uncontrollably. TweetMeanwhile, on the shoulder of the northbound 101 Freeway, Steve Holmstrom tried to catch a glimpse of his home.“I left last night because it was getting too close,” he said, adding that his spent the night with his children in Carpinteria.The abandoned structure next to his house burned down Wednesday night, he said. The 62-year-old, who lives on Fillmore Avenue, said he was worried because his home is made of wood.“Thankfully they saved it,” he said.Holmstrom said he’s lived in this area since 1972, and his house survived other disasters, including a devastating mudslide that killed residents at the base of the hill.“These firefighters are amazing. This whole place could’ve gone,” he said. “I feel so much better. Last night was kind of a panic.”","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:49:01.468Z","datePublished":"2017-12-07T17:37:00.000Z","headline":"Residents in La Conchita relieved to find homes still standing","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a3f2fa1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x675+0+113/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff2%2F6c%2F8b34e360ea98e8f0a6aef2d6cbdb%2Fla-lb-media-dqdb6qcv4aawgxj-20171207-095652","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Sarah Parvini"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#residents-in-la-conchita-relieved-to-find-homes-still-standing"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageA brush fire broke out Thursday morning in Malibu, but firefighters were able to contain it before it struck homes.The brush fire broke out in the 5300 block of Horizon Drive in the hills on the northern end of the city. The fire was burning amid a cluster of homes in a canyon.

They also warned of isolated gusts of up to 80 mph in the mountains.Winds will gradually weaken Friday and Saturday, officials said.Q: Why are the the winds such a factor for firefighters?Powerful winds can push existing fires but also help fan new ones.“We are in the beginning of a protracted wind event,” said Ken Pimlott, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.“There will be no ability to fight fire in these kinds of winds,” Pimlott said. “At the end of the day, we need everyone in the public to listen and pay attention. This is not ‘watch the news and go about your day.’ This is pay attention minute by minute … keep your head on a swivel.”Q: How do high winds affect the firefight?When the Thomas fire broke out Monday evening, the winds were so strong that water-dropping aircraft were grounded and firefighters on the ground could not keep pace with the flames.Those conditions continued through much of Tuesday, as the fire swept through neighborhoods in Ventura, destroying hundreds of homes.The firefight improved as winds calmed, allowing officials to do battle in the air and on the ground when the fire was moving slower.But even Wednesday, the size of the fire in Ventura County continued to grow.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:01:06.088Z","datePublished":"2017-12-07T14:04:00.000Z","headline":"Firefighters at mercy of Santa Ana winds as fire siege enters third day","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Sarah Parvini"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Joseph Serna"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Alene Tchekmedyian"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#firefighters-at-mercy-of-santa-ana-winds-as-fire-siege-enters-third-day"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"The Ventura fire continued to spread Thursday morning amid high winds, forcing new evacuations along the coast and inland.

But what should you be gathering ahead of time to be prepared if you must evacuate?The basic disaster supply kit should include nonperishable foods and one gallon of water a day for at least three days, a first aid kit, flashlights, prescription medication, a change of clothing, sanitation supplies, cellphone chargers and other basics. Pack similar items for your pets. Put smaller animals in carriers and be sure dogs and cats have collars and tags.Documents such as insurance policies, identification cards and bank account records should be carried in waterproof, portable containers or saved electronically, according to Ready.gov, a federal emergency preparedness website.Before you leave, windows and doors should be locked and flammable window shades and curtains should be removed, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Air conditioning and gas should be shut off, but lights should be left on so firefighters can see the house in smoke. Cal Fire also recommends moving flammable furniture to the center of the room, away from doors and windows. Evacuees should plan at least two evacuation routes in case major roads or highways close as well as several places to take shelter, such as a friend’s home or a motel.

She wasn’t open for business but took advantage of working electricity in her shop.Her condo, a two-minute walk away, has been without power since Monday night, a couple of hours before she was forced to evacuate because of the Thomas fire. The blaze came within about 200 feet of her home, but the condo was left unscathed.Since then, Nolte has been waiting for the electricity to be restored to her home. She’s unsure when that will be but is trying to make the most of it until then.“I’m kind of sticking it out,” she said. Nolte planned to hold a dinner party at her store Wednesday for 10 of her friends in the same condominium complex. All were left without electricity and have become something of a support group for one another, she said. Nolte’s store has a working refrigerator, so that’s where she intends to store the food for the dinner.Tuesday evening, the group of friends barbecued whatever food they could find. Nolte scoured a supermarket in town that also was without electricity, scoring still-cold rib-eye steaks. Wednesday afternoon, she unloaded bottles of water and coffee from her vehicle and placed them on the floor next to a Christmas tree and other holiday trinkets. She turned on a floor fan facing the door in an attempt to keep the smoke outside and away from her rugs and upholstered furniture inside. She opened the store just three months ago. The smoke wasn’t so bad earlier in the week. Wednesday was different. “It’s going to be a mask day,” she told herself when she woke up Wednesday morning. If the power doesn’t come back and the air quality remains the same, she may just leave the store and stay with family in Westlake Village.  “There’s nothing to do here but breathe bad air,” Nolte said.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:54:03.470Z","datePublished":"2017-12-07T00:38:00.000Z","headline":"Fire-related power outages leave Ventura residents scrambling","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/eee844f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+192/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F77%2Fc3918f4f87fe7321022fcf836398%2Fla-lb-media-image-uploaded-from-ios-20171206-172951","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Cindy Carcamo"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#fire-related-power-outages-leave-ventura-residents-scrambling"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageOn Little Tujunga Canyon Road at the Wildlife Waystation, staff members worked on little sleep to keep the wild and exotic animal sanctuary — and its residents — safe.Martine Colette, founder of the Wildlife Waystation, kept her walkie-talkie close while she worked Wednesday, as firetrucks rolled in and out of the parking lot. Smoke billowed from the mountains nearby, sending ash through the air. Firefighters continued to put out spot fires throughout Wednesday.Colette, who lives in a home at the center of the facility, woke up at 4:30 a.m. Tuesday to see the fire blazing nearby. She and her staff immediately began working to ensure the animals didn’t burn in their enclosures.Once dawn came, they began preparing for evacuation. They separated the different types of caging, some suitable for hyenas, others for Siberian tigers, another suitable for a chimpanzee. They had to figure out what to do about the buffalo roaming loose in the fire zone, as well as what they’d do with animals with small lungs — like birds — who wouldn’t be able to survive the smoke. “The smoke was very thick,” Colette said. “It was very, very scary.”The power went out early Tuesday evening. “You’re now working in the dark and you’re working with very dangerous animals. You’re working with lions and tigers and leopards and hyenas and mountain lions, things like that,” she said. Staff worked by flashlight.“I have the greatest staff anybody could possibly want,” she said.Some of the animals were evacuated to a zoo and others to motion picture compounds — facilities capable of dealing with them. Of 350 to 400 animals usually housed at Wildlife Waystation, 100 were not evacuated. Early Wednesday, the fire kicked off again.“Out of nowhere, this huge inferno exploded,” she said. “It felt like you were in the middle of hell with everything burning around you.”The fire burned a portion of the property, but there has not been a loss of animal life, as far as Colette knows right now. Colette founded the Wildlife Waystation in 1976. It relies on donations and memberships to raise the 2.5 to 3 million needed every year to continue operating. They estimate the cost of damage and of evacuating the animals as being easily in the tens of thousands of dollars. “We truly appreciate any gift through this very difficult time,” Colette said.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:50:14.992Z","datePublished":"2017-12-07T00:36:00.000Z","headline":"The Creek fire left Wildlife Waystation staffers working in the dark with lions, chimpanzees and bison","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ea3102/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1100x619+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F93%2F8e%2F5f09b2017482efcdd76dd3aeac5b%2F1100x619","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Brittny Mejia"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#the-creek-fire-left-wildlife-waystation-staffers-working-in-the-dark-with-lions-chimpanzees-and-bison"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageAll Los Angeles Unified schools in the San Fernando Valley as well as 17 schools on the city’s Westside will be closed for the rest of the week, district officials announced Wednesday afternoon.The decision closes 265 schools in neighborhoods affected by the wildfires raging in and near Los Angeles. The district’s website has a full list, as well as a reminder that everyone else is still expected to come to school this Thursday and Friday.On Wednesday, more than 50 L.A.

Firefighters said they weren’t sure how the Skirball fire had spread to Morago Drive.There are about 36 homes in the gated community. All are surrounded by hills that were engulfed in flames Wednesday morning. Neighbors said well-known public figures and celebrities such as Jerry West and Rupert Murdoch live on the street. Magic Johnson once owned a house on the street, neighbors said.Residents in the community were woken up at 5 a.m. Wednesday by police demanding they evacuate. “Everyone was great about evacuating. They didn’t get in the way,” said Captain John Ziola with the Los Angeles City Fire Department. “They were emotional, though.”Ziola said he is proud of the firefighters. He pointed to the hills above and said that at least four homes were destroyed by the fire. Ziola said he is worried that the winds will pick up again Wednesday night.By 2 p.m., some residents were allowed back in to grab a few belongings. Terri Greenbaum, who lives in a two-story gray home on the 1200 block of Moraga Drive, stood on her front lawn next to her doormat, which had burned. “That’s how close the flames got,” she said, pointing to it.Greenbaum said she and her husband were woken up by the police knocking on their doors telling them to leave. She stuck her head outside the house and saw the flames for herself. “My husband and I threw our clothes and computers into the car and left,” she said. There was no damage to the house itself, her home for 15 years. “I was a little worried when I saw the firetruck outside when I was coming up,” she said. “But my home is fine for now.” ","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:03:07.310Z","datePublished":"2017-12-06T22:45:00.000Z","headline":"Firefighters allow some Bel-Air residents to return and collect their belongings","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b921a0c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1100x619+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc0%2Fb3%2F1115b3ecb20c2ecb216fde6ecd2f%2F1100x619","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Melissa Etehad"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#firefighters-allow-some-bel-air-residents-to-return-and-collect-their-belongings"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageBrent Clark, 58, stood on the roof of his Faria Beach home and began watering the wooden roof tiles. Past the railroad tracks and Highway 1, flames made their way down the hillsides as they burned through acres of chaparral. Looking at the flames, Kay Clark, 58, turned her attention to a cypress tree near their home.“That tree worries me,” she said.The erratic wind shifts had driven the Thomas fire as far as Hobson Beach Park, which sits about three miles north from of Faria Beach. The fire has kept residents nervous even here.“Everything depends on what the winds do,” Brent Clark said.Tuesday night, residents of Faria Beach were told to evacuate as flames made their way over a ridge and began to approach the small beach community. The fire was headed toward Solimar Beach, just south of Faria Beach.Among those evacuated was Joe Ruffner, 65. “The wind was blowing north, south, sometimes it seemed like it was doing both at the same time,” Ruffner said.Kay Clark said she noticed “fire whirls” as the flames continued to approach the seaside town.The fire left all the beach communities without power Tuesday. Wednesday was Day Two. Eating a chocolate pastry,  Ruffner hoped the power would come back soon. Nearby, Jim Petit, 82, used a generator to keep power in his home. He said he put five gallons of gasoline into the generator in the morning and used a timer to keep track of it.Outside their homes, Petit and Kay Clark talked.“We’re not out of it yet,” Petit mentioned.“We’re still not out of the woods,” Key Clark said.As hours went by, ash settled on beach rocks, on cars, even the hair of onlookers who cut through the beach town to photograph the fire. At least three Amtrak Surfliners passed through the town, even as the fires raged on.The ash, upon a closer look, consisted of burned leaves, mostly oak.Ruffner said he was surprised to see how far the charred oak had travelled. “It brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ‘fall leaves,’” Kay Clark said. “It looks like it’s snowing. It’s like Christmas. An upside-down Christmas.”Nineteen miles North, residents in La Conchita braced for the worst as they watched the orange hazy smoke at a distance. Two-story and single-story homes sit along the base of the hillsides. The buildings sit next to each other with very little space in between. The neighborhood is surrounded by dry chaparral and other plants that have not burned for decades. Some residents watered their roofs, and others packed things into cars and trucks. A few focused on getting their horses from a nearby stable. Like everybody else, this small beach community was on edge. Residents wondered what the winds would bring.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:51:11.432Z","datePublished":"2017-12-06T22:19:00.000Z","headline":"To some, the oaky ash in Faria Beach looks like snow, or an ‘upside down Christmas’","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/794bc3a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+99/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F6d%2F3aff49126f5e83de12d3cadbb585%2Fla-me-thomas-fire-photos-048","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Ruben Vives"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#to-some-the-oaky-ash-in-faria-beach-looks-like-snow-or-an-upside-down-christmas"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"TweetMike Hall-Mounsey, president and CEO of the Ojai Valley School, visited the hilltop upper school campus Wednesday to survey the damage wrought by the Thomas fire.The school’s two-story dormitory for girls, which also has apartments for faculty, was destroyed. The science and technology building, erected about a decade ago with labs, lecture halls and classrooms, was leveled by the flames. Classroom doors were charred, and a part of the boys’ dormitory sustained damage.“It came through here — gale-force winds with embers,” Hall-Mounsey said. “Winds burst doors open. Embers reached into attics and windows. The firefighters said they couldn’t save it all. They saved what they could.” The rest of the fall semester has been canceled for the upper school, which has about 120 students — 40 of whom attend only for days. The rest board.Administrators made the decision Monday night to evacuate and put students on two buses. They fled by 8:30 p.m. and were taken to the lower school campus, which was not damaged. As they drove off, Hall-Mounsey saw the lights of firefighters’ bulldozers on the ridge across the canyon, which sits over St. Thomas Aquinas College.After they left, the blaze roared over the ridge and ripped through the canyon, kicking up embers that sent the fire hopscotching across campus. The head of the upper school and a maintenance worker stayed as long as they could to douse hot spots and protect the property. No students or faculty were injured in the fire. Many, though, lost all their possessions. Family members of students, faculty and alumni also have had houses severely damaged or destroyed, compounding the loss, the president said. At the burned dorm, cracked bowls, a blackened oven and the charred remnants of an ironing board were among the rubble. Heat emanated from the pile of detritus. Hall-Mounsey is hopeful, he said, as he walked past the smoldering science center. Typically the hilltop campus provides views of the entire Ojai Valley below. On Wednesday, under an orange sun and a smoky sky, he could barely see the floor of the charred canyons below. “The bones of the campus are good. We can replace what we lost,” he said. “The heart and soul of the school is alive and well.”He is determined to see the school reopen for the spring semester on Jan. 8, with some students housed in modular units on parts of the campus — such as the athletic fields — that were spared. “A lot of our philosophy is about resilience, grit, backpacking and making do,” he said. “We will have a pioneers spirit when we come back.” Alumni and family members from all over the world have expressed support and pledged to help the school rebuild. Ojai Valley School is among a number of private and boarding schools in the area that attract students from across the nation and around the world.

Roy almost lost control of the motor home driving down a mountain. Then, fire.On Tuesday afternoon, at a campground west of Santa Clarita, Roy DeFilippis was watching TV, deciding whether to drink more coffee or switch to beer. “And all of a sudden, we hear sirens and sirens, and police came out and told me us we had to evacuate,” he said.The DeFilippis stepped outside and saw flames as tall as their RV. They ensured their most precious cargo — their eight Yorkshire terriers — was in the motor home and rushed onto Highway 126.They left behind the Honda Civic they’d been towing. There was no time to hook it up.The Rye fire has burned 7,000 acres and destroyed at least one structure. On Wednesday, as 575 firefighters worked to contain the 7,000-acre fire, farmers and field workers continued their morning routines. Sprinklers watered a variety of crops, and citrus trees soaked up the sun. Rich Brocchini, the public information officers for Cal Fire Team No. 6, said the fire is only 5% contained and urged residents to pay attention to Cal Fire’s online updates. “Please stay updated,” he said. “This is going to be a pretty significant wind event for the next couple days.”Late Wednesday morning, the DeFilippis parked in a gravel lot between Santa Clarita and Fillmore, waiting for the campground to reopen at noon. They weren’t sure whether their car survived. ","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:01:18.107Z","datePublished":"2017-12-06T21:33:00.000Z","headline":"Road-trippers save their dogs — and ditch their Civic — as they flee Rye fire","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bc5c9e8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+192/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe1%2Ff3%2Ffe956d7d00c5bdc6d5c1c51766e7%2Fla-me-edu-saving-their-precious-cargo-20171206","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Jaclyn Cosgrove"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#road-trippers-save-their-dogs-and-ditch-their-civic-as-they-flee-rye-fire"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageJacking up prices for essentials during a state of emergency is illegal, California Atty. Gen.

Those who violate the law could face one year of imprisonment, and/or a fine up to $10,000. Becerra asked anyone who believes they’ve been a victim of price gouging to file a complaint through his website or by calling (800) 952-5225 or contacting local law enforcement. “For any in the community who would give in to the temptation to benefit from others’ misfortune, we will take price gouging very seriously and will act to ensure it is not profitable,” Ventura County Dist. Atty. Gregory Totten said in the statement.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:04:09.592Z","datePublished":"2017-12-06T21:25:00.000Z","headline":"California Atty. Gen.

Together, they were able to scrounge a few ceramic plates and mugs. Marcus said that when he and his mother, 92, evacuated Monday, they had no more than 10 minutes to leave. He saw the flames — “an orange glow like the Earth was angry” — and knew it was time to evacuate. “It was enough time to grab the family and that was it,” he said. “That was all I had.”His neighbors’ homes on both sides also burned down, along with one house across from his and the homes along the ridge above. Smoke puffed from the ground, which still radiated heat. “I feel loss, but my family is safe and well and that’s all I care about. These are all possessions that can be replaced,” he said, walking through piles of burned wood and appliances. Behind him stood a shower, blackened but perfectly intact. “This was a happy place where we celebrated Thanksgiving and Christmas. Everything my mom has collected and cherished is gone,” he said. As his sons looked through the property, Marcus searched for one particular piece of the home — a portion of the driveway that had his and his father’s names etched into it. They’d scratched it into the concrete when it was repaved in 1984. “I was hoping to find some jewelry, but it all melted,” he said. His sons did find a small plate, embellished with the phrase “Little things mean a lot.” The plate, from Mother’s Day 1982, was in perfect shape. TweetThe home was renovated in 2008, he said. Marcus and his mother are staying at his nephew’s house nearby until his insurance company provides him with temporary housing. “I kept hoping we’d come back and there would be a house,” he said. “Now we rebuild and start over. There’s not much you can do otherwise.” His son Steven popped his head up where the fireplace once stood. “Hey!” he shouted. “I found an angel!”He waved a small “Precious Moments” figurine with a halo atop its head, then tossed it to his brother with a laugh.

He ran outside in his boxer shorts, and saw his neighbors on Bellagio Road standing in the street and packing their cars. The moon was blood red.He turned on the news, and saw aerial footage of his eight-unit apartment building from a helicopter monitoring the Skirball fire. He turned to his girlfriend and said, “We should pack.”By 7 a.m., fire trucks were racing up and down the street, apparently trying to get as close to the fire as possible, Rogow said. He waved to one truck and shouted, “Should I leave?” A firefighter gave him a thumbs-up, he said, but he wasn’t sure what that meant. Rogow packed the couple’s cat, Zeppelin, and a bag of kitty litter. His girlfriend found a stack of photographs of her late father. At about 8:30 a.m., Rogow got an emergency alert on his phone advising him of the evacuation area boundaries: the 405 Freeway on the west, Sunset Boulevard to the south, Roscomare Road to the east and Mulholland Drive to the north. His building was squarely inside it. Then he remembered a conversation he’d had with his neighbor, who had temporarily left the state for cancer treatment. Before she left, Rogow asked her: “If your house is burning down, what do I grab?”Her medals, she said. She had more than three dozen, from marathons, half marathons and 5k races at Disneyworld. So Rogow broke her side window and grabbed them. As they left, police taped off his street, Rogow said. Everyone in his apartment building evacuated, he said, but one homeowner down the street vowed to stay and protect his house. Rogow planned to go to a friend’s apartment in Westwood with a rooftop where they could watch the fire.

The crews will have relatively cool temperatures in the 50s and 60s, but also low humidity and winds stronger than 25 miles per hour. “Our greatest threat is — and will always continue to be — the wind,” Los Angeles Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas said.Black smoke began billowing from the fire area just after 9 a.m., apparently burning in a canyon area thick with 50 to 60 feet of brush, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said. The area did not burn in the 1961 Bel-Air fires, meaning the brush there had built for many decades. The city will declare a local state of emergency Wednesday morning, Garcetti said. “These are days that break your heart,” Garcetti said. “These are also days that show the resilience of our city.” Officials urged residents in mandatory evacuation areas to leave, assuring them that firefighters would protect all the homes they could. “This is no time to be a hero,” said Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck.“We are losing some property and that is tragic, but the most important thing is people’s lives,” said Councilman Paul Koretz, whose district includes the area on fire.  Other fires in Southern California have stretched resources thin. The Los Angeles Fire Department has scaled back the number of employees and engines responding to 911 calls in other areas of the city, Terrazas said.  Other agencies are loaning bulldozers to dig fire lines, because the city’s machines are in use at the Creek fire, Garcetti said, and the county’s are being used at the Rye fire in Santa Clarita.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:55:51.022Z","datePublished":"2017-12-06T18:32:00.000Z","headline":"L.A.

I wish I could be more specific. But this is no time for false promises.”Eastern portions of the mountain community of about 20,000 were under mandatory evacuation orders. Downtown residents and shop owners, though, faced voluntary evacuation, and worried that a shift in the wind could drive wildfires on surrounding ridgelines farther south and into town.On Wednesday, signs of Christmas along downtown Ojai’s 19th-century-style promenades provided a moody contrast to the “closed” signs dangling from the doors of restaurants, shops and bed-and-breakfast inns. ImageOjai authorities hoped to reduce anxiety by handing out flyers offering “current information” hotline numbers and computer links. But communications systems were spotty, at best, in the community where the only ways in and out were two-lane country roads.On Wednesday morning, Doug LaBarre, 70, was among the many residents who bellied up to the counter of a downtown fire station with an urgent question for Capt. Paul Berrera.“The city itself is not threatened, right?” LBarre said. “My 95-year-old father lives in my guesthouse. So are we safe?”“All I can tell you,” Berrera said with a sympathetic smile, “is this: To ensure your father’s safety, prepare to leave if necessary.” Image","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:55:43.063Z","datePublished":"2017-12-06T18:19:00.000Z","headline":"Anxious Ojai residents ask whether their city is going to burn down","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ed57d9c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1100x619+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa4%2Fc9%2Feecad7618972d545e162d26ceb05%2F1100x619","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Louis Sahagun"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#anxious-ojai-residents-ask-whether-their-city-is-going-to-burn-down"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Tweet","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:51:39.136Z","datePublished":"2017-12-06T18:15:00.000Z","headline":"Former International Space Station astronaut sends his sympathy to fire-stricken Southern California","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#former-international-space-station-astronaut-sends-his-sympathy-to-fire-stricken-southern-california"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Tweet","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:02:14.755Z","datePublished":"2017-12-06T18:12:00.000Z","headline":"An evacuation preparedness checklist from L.A.

Have they knocked on your door? There’s a fire. They are going to start evacuating. Get your important stuff and clothes,” the babysitter told her.What fire? Gutierrez thought to herself. It was 9:01 p.m.The 32-year-old ran outside her mobile home on Wheeler Canyon Road into a wall of gray smoke. She panicked. Minutes later, a law enforcement official knocked on her door. He told her she had a few minutes to pack up and evacuate.Frantically, she packed diapers for 18-month-old Genesis, a pair of shoes for 3-year-old Osiel. She grabbed clothes for all of them, medical cards, her U.S. citizenship naturalization certificate. ImageHer husband, Alex, froze, unwilling to accept that the fire was heading toward them.“Don’t worry. The wind is blowing in another direction,” he told her.Still, she threw her belongings and blankets into the car. That’s when she saw flames approaching. She buckled in her two children in one car. Her husband jumped into another vehicle. They headed to Gutierrez’s mother’s home.On Tuesday morning, she returned to a steel shell of what appeared to be her mobile home. Everything was gone. The only way she could tell her two-bedroom home apart from the others that had burned were a pair of tire rims her husband planned to sell. Alex refused to believe their home was gone. Instead he headed to work as usual at a nearby ranch, where he irrigates strawberry fields. He finally accepted the news when Gutierrez texted him photos of their charred home.On Tuesday afternoon, Gutierrez wrangled her tots as she attempted to eat a tamale at the Santa Paula Senior Center, which served as an evacuation center for fire refugees. Her sister, Maricela Martinez, a landscaper, kept her company and helped her care for the kids.“Oh, no,” she said suddenly. Martinez had just gotten a text message from one of her clients.“Hello, our house burned down today so we will not be needing yard service in the near future. I prepaid you through January, we can work it out later,” the text message said.Martinez shook her head.“So many people have lost their homes,” she told her sister.Gutierrez, who was recently laid off from her job picking strawberries after the company went out of business, worried about finding a new home and paying upcoming bills. She doesn’t have rental insurance. The $700 in cash she’d saved up for Christmas presents and stored on a shelf in her home was gone. Framed pictures of her son’s baptism and daughter’s birth were destroyed. Her eyes welled with tears as she thought of the photos. ImageStill, she said she’s thankful for her health and what she was able to salvage from her home.“I saved the most important thing,” she said. “My kids.”Gutierrez said she was thankful she didn’t have to stay overnight at the evacuation center. She could stay with family, she said. Others weren’t as lucky.Just outside the center, homeowners in a neighborhood across the street hosed down their roofs. They watched as white and gray smoke billowed up as helicopters carrying fire retardant and water flew past. From just half a mile north, the Thomas fire headed their way.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:01:22.080Z","datePublished":"2017-12-06T03:37:00.000Z","headline":"Thomas fire victim loses her home but saves ‘the most important thing’ -- her children","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/753855c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+192/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2Fe8%2F3fe45fed4e34b5b338845db24c80%2Fla-lb-media-image-uploaded-from-ios-3-20171205-203011","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Cindy Carcamo"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html#thomas-fire-victim-loses-her-home-but-saves-the-most-important-thing-her-children"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageWhen Stacy Reardon learned that the flames of the Rye fire were nearing her 4-year-old daughter’s school in Santa Clarita, she jumped in her car and raced there. But when the usual one-hour drive from her work in Sherman Oaks turned into a 2-1/2 hour drive with flames sometimes within 10 feet of her car, she started to panic. “I was crying all day,” Reardon said. As she crept up Rye Canyon Road toward Santa Clarita Valley International Charter School, gray smoke filled the air.When she neared the school, she told a police officer who had blocked the road that she needed to go pick up her daughter. “He let me go through but told me drive slow because of all the smoke,” she said. About one minute away from the school, Reardon said the flames were so intense that her car began to overheat. Ten feet away, the shoulder of road was engulfed in flames.She parked her car and walked inside the school, shaking. “The school supervisor saw me crying and told me my daughter was fine.

Gonzalez's house — the tan one with the big brown porch — stood untouched, but flames burned about 40 feet away.She tried not to cry as a gust of wind fanned the flames closer.“You work so hard all your life, and now this,” Gonzalez said. “But what can you do? Fire is fire.” Gonzales and her husband moved into the neighborhood off Coronado Circle two years ago, like many of their neighbors. The first homes in the area were built about a decade ago, and dozens more were added in the last three years, residents said.The homes border hundreds of acres of undeveloped land in the northern corner of Santa Paula. The land there has not seen a fire in more than three decades, and the Thomas fire is eating through years of brush and debris, residents said.Gonzalez and her husband scrambled to evacuate by 6 p.m. Monday, just after they got off work. They fled with clothes, passports and other paperwork, but left her husband’s most-cherished possessions in the garage: a 1959 Chevrolet El Camino and a 1928 Ford (“a Bonnie and Clyde car,” Gonzalez said). “We just had to go,” Gonzalez said. “We didn’t know how fast it was going to come.”Meanwhile, Milo Solis, 38, stood perched on the concrete drainage channel behind his house on North 10th Street and Coronado Circle, spraying down a row of bushes and bougainvillea with a garden hose. His home backs up to the burning hillside. The flames were about 100 yards from his property line.Solis evacuated Monday night, grabbing a few changes of clothes and his life insurance policy. Then he rode out of the neighborhood on his Harley. (“I couldn’t leave her behind,” Solis said. “I evacuated in style.”)Against the advice of firefighters and police who had blocked off the neighborhood, Solis returned to his house Tuesday morning to put out any spot fires. The homes in the neighborhood are close together, and others would burn if one went up, he said.At 10 a.m., the fire had stopped at a wide gap in the brush. Solis continued to spray the bushes with water. “If it gets past the break, I’m going to have to get out of here,” he said.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:51:43.057Z","datePublished":"2017-12-05T19:23:00.000Z","headline":"Santa Paula residents eye approaching flames with trepidation","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8eb3e70/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+191/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4c%2F79%2Facfbee8763dd88c23d1004ff6a80%2Fla-lb-media-image-uploaded-from-ios-1-20171205-113135","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Laura J.
