Negotiations were delayed by memorial services this week for former President George H.W. Bush.The temporary measure gives Democrats and Republicans more time to find a resolution to their biggest hurdle: funding a wall on the U.S. Mexico border wall.Trump says he wants $5 billion for parts of a concrete wall on the southern border and is willing to shut down the government if he doesn't get it. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has said Democrats will provide no more than $1.6 billion for \"border security,\" because the wall is a waste of money.The president's demands for wall funding from Congress come after he said during the campaign that Mexico would pay for it. This week he said on Twitter that a $25 billion border wall would pay for itself in two months, without providing evidence.Most of the U.S. government's $1.2 trillion discretionary budget has been appropriated already by Congress for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. Departments at a risk of a partial shutdown late this month include the departments of State, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Treasury and Homeland Security.Talks to resolve the differences have been on hold since a meeting among Trump, Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California originally slated for Dec. 4 was postponed due to Bush memorial events. The three are scheduled to meet on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter.Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby of Alabama told reporters the rest of the seven-bill spending package being negotiated is \"basically done.\"Shelby in recent weeks had tried to broker a compromise in which Trump's $5 billion request would be split over two years, but Schumer has rejected that.Some Democrats have been willing to trade border wall funding for deportation protections for young undocumented immigrants. Pelosi ruled out such a deal in remarks to reporters Thursday.The stopgap government funding measure also would extend the National Flood Insurance Program, which provides subsidized coverage for homes in flood-prone areas, to Dec. 21.","dateModified":"2018-12-06T19:15:24.841Z","datePublished":"2018-12-06T19:12:00.000Z","headline":"Shutdown postponed by two weeks under plan approved by Congress","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/50a8522/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+130/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7b%2Fa8%2Fbc681bb3b4ab3d97f0c32aebdce9%2Fla-lb-media-apphoto-saudiarabiawriterkilled2-20181206-104553","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Erik Wasson"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#shutdown-postponed-by-two-weeks-under-plan-approved-by-congress"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageA bipartisan group of senators filed a resolution Wednesday condemning Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as responsible for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, directly challenging President Trump to do the same.\"This resolution -- without equivocation -- definitively states that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia was complicit in the murder of Mr. [Jamal] Khashoggi and has been a wrecking ball to the region jeopardizing our national security interests on multiple fronts,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in a statement accompanying the release of the resolution. \"It will be up to Saudi Arabia as to how to deal with this matter. But it is up to the United States to firmly stand for who we are and what we believe.\"The resolution put forward by Graham and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who are expected to lead the Judiciary Committee together next year, comes just one day after CIA Director Gina Haspel briefed leading senators about the details of the agency's assessment that Mohammed ordered and monitored the killing and dismemberment of Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. Senators emerged from that closed-door briefing furious not only with Saudi Arabia, but Trump as well for dismissing the heft of the CIA's findings.\"You have to be willfully blind not to come to the conclusion that this was orchestrated and organized by people under the command of MBS and that he was intricately involved in the demise of Mr. Khashoggi,\" Graham said following the briefing, referring to Mohammed by his initials. He added that Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo and Defense Secretary James N. Mattis, who briefed senators last week, were at best being \"good soldiers\" and at worst were \"in the pocket of Saudi Arabia\" for presenting the evidence of Mohammed's involvement as inconclusive.The release of the resolution condemning Mohammed also comes as the Senate is preparing to move ahead with debate on a resolution to curtail U.S. support for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. Though the Yemen resolution does not directly address Khashoggi's murder, its popularity is a sign of how strained the United States' patience with Saudi Arabia is on multiple fronts, including its role in worsening the civilian cost of the war in Yemen, cited by the United Nations as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.Last week, the Senate voted 63 to 37 to advance the Yemen resolution past an opening procedural hurdle. But Graham and Feinstein's resolution on the crown prince has the potential of drawing broader support, especially from Republicans, who are deeply divided about how fiercely to punish Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi's killing.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who has been an outspoken advocate for human rights and is seen as one of the more influential foreign policy voices in the GOP, did not vote for the Yemen resolution last week or sign on to a bipartisan measure last month to sanction Saudi officials and cease weapons transfers to the kingdom. But he is an original co-sponsor of the resolution condemning Mohammed over Khashoggi's death.So is Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), who represents the other end of the GOP spectrum in terms of recent Saudi-related votes and endorsements. Young was an initial co-sponsor of the bill Graham wrote with Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) to sanction Saudi officials deemed responsible for Khashoggi's killing and stop the sale of anything but exclusively defensive weapons to the kingdom until it ceased hostilities in Yemen. Young also voted to advance the Yemen resolution — something Graham did as well, though Graham has signaled he will not be lending any similar support to the measure, fearing it may establish a precedent of invoking the War Powers Act too broadly.Sens. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) are listed as original co-sponsors of the resolution condemning Mohammed, which also urges Saudi Arabia to negotiate with Houthi rebels to end the Yemen war, work out a political solution to its standoff with Qatar and release political prisoners.But how much sway the resolution has probably comes down to how forcefully the administration decides to heed it -- and thus far, Trump has not shown any interest in condemning the crown prince the way the senators hope he will.Demirjian reports for the Washington Post.","dateModified":"2018-12-06T14:55:36.963Z","datePublished":"2018-12-06T14:34:00.000Z","headline":"Bipartisan Senate group wants to formally blame Saudi crown prince for journalist’s killing","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d7c9f7a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fea%2F19%2Faadbf4dfa1d365bf2395cff0fc3f%2Fla-1544020687-7cw35hw0vz-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Karoun Demirjian"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#bipartisan-senate-group-wants-to-formally-blame-saudi-crown-prince-for-journalists-killing"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe U.S. Postal Service will suspend regular mail delivery Wednesday, which President Trump has declared a national day of mourning in honor of former President George H.W.

Deval Patrick of Massachusetts will soon announce he won't launch a 2020 presidential campaign, according to three sources familiar with his plans. They did not say why the Democrat decided against a run. A formal announcement was delayed as the country observed a day of mourning for President George H.W. Bush, one source said. News of Patrick's plans was first reported by Politico. Patrick, 62, served two terms as governor, from 2007 to 2015, was assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Clinton administration and since leaving the governor's office has been a managing director for Bain Capital. Patrick traveled the country in support of Democratic candidates in the recent midterm election. Earlier this year, some of Patrick's supporters and close advisors started the Reason to Believe political action committee, “a grassroots organization dedicated to advancing a positive, progressive vision for our nation in 2018 and 2020.” Reason to Believe PAC had been holding meetups across the country, including in early presidential primary states. While Patrick is opting against a 2020 run, dozens of Democrats are considering jumping in, including nearly a half-dozen members of the Senate, several House members, and other Massachusetts politicians. On Tuesday, Michael Avenatti, the attorney for adult film star Stormy Daniels and a vocal critic of President Trump, said in a statement that he would run. Patrick had previously expressed some concerns about breaking through if he sought the nomination, telling David Axelrod, a former advisor to President Obama, that he wasn't sure he could stand out in such a large field. “It's hard to see how you even get noticed in such a big, broad field without being shrill, sensational or a celebrity, and I'm none of those things and I'm never going to be any of those things,” Patrick said in a September interview with Axelrod. ","dateModified":"2018-12-05T17:27:48.900Z","datePublished":"2018-12-05T17:17:00.000Z","headline":"Former Massachusetts Gov.

Last December, Trump shrank the monument, first established by President Clinton in 1996, by 46% based on Zinke's recommendation.Noel owns 40 acres that had been surrounded by the monument, but now lies outside its boundaries. The new boundaries also would make it easier to construct the proposed Lake Powell Pipeline, which would deliver water to sites in Kane County that include Noel's property. Earlier this year, the Interior Department had proposed selling off 120 acres of federal land from the former monument that lay adjacent to some of Noel's land holdings, but later reversed the plan.\"We found no evidence that Noel influenced the DOI's proposed revisions to the [monument's] boundaries, that Zinke or other DOI staff involved in the project were aware of Noel's financial interest in the revised boundaries, or that they gave Noel any preferential treatment in the resulting proposed boundaries,\" Kendall wrote.Neither the Interior Department nor the inspector general's office would release the actual investigative report. In the letter, Kendall writes that her office will provide the report to Congress \"no sooner than 31 days\" from Nov. 21, when it is provided it to Zinke's office.The Associated Press first reported the inspector general's conclusions Monday night, but did not provide details from the report itself.Noel emailed Zinke about the effort to alter Grand Staircase-Escalante, according to emails released by Interior under the Freedom of Informational Act. But those emails do not make references to Noel's land holdings. Noel also pushed to rename a Utah highway in honor of Trump, but abandoned that effort in March after some of his fellow Republicans objected to the idea.Noel did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.The inspector general's office still has at least two ongoing probes of the secretary, including one focused on his real estate dealings in Whitefish, Mont., and another regarding his decision to deny a permit to two Connecticut tribes who were hoping to jointly run a casino after MGM Resorts International lobbied against it.Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift welcomed the watchdog's conclusions.\"The report shows exactly what the secretary's office has known all along — that the monument boundaries were adjusted in accordance with all rules, regulations and laws,\" she said in an email. \"This report is also the latest example of opponents and special interest groups ginning up fake and misleading stories, only to be proven false after expensive and time consuming inquiries by the IG's office.\"But Kendall's spokeswoman, Nancy DiPaolo, defended the inquiry, even though she said the report has not been publicly released \"and we will not be speaking specifically about the matter at this time.\"\"The OIG opens investigations based on credible allegations and reports our findings objectively and independently,\" DiPaolo added. \"Any time or resources spent investigating conduct or activity that may be a violation of law, regulation or policy is a service to the public, Congress and the Department.\"Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement that he still intended to investigate the way Zinke and his colleague redrew the boundaries for Grand Staircase-Escalante and another Utah national monument, Bears Ears, next year.\"I have great respect for the inspector general, and I accept these findings, but Secretary Zinke should have known the people he listened to while destroying our national monuments had disqualifying conflicts of interest,\" he said. \"Should I chair the Natural Resources Committee in the next Congress, the process he and President Trump used to destroy Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante will be front and center in our oversight and investigations efforts. We need to know why they ignored overwhelming public expressions of support for both Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, why they ignored Native American tribes throughout their decision-making, and why they removed protections on parcels of land with known mineral deposits.\"Eilperin and Rein report for the Washington Post.","dateModified":"2018-11-27T20:04:43.652Z","datePublished":"2018-11-27T19:40:00.000Z","headline":"Interior Department watchdog clears Zinke in investigation of Utah national monument","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/573d176/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1022x575+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa9%2Fad%2Fe2cfaca896513b2e5d17e2e8cc80%2Fimg-5bf48224-turbine-la-1542750753-gfu2a5vu7g-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Juliet Eilperin"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Lisa Rein"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#interior-department-watchdog-clears-zinke-in-investigation-of-utah-national-monument"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageLarry Kudlow, President Trump’s top economic advisor, said Tuesday that China’s response to U.S. efforts to rework the two economic superpowers’ trade relationship has been “extremely disappointing” but the planned meeting this weekend between the nations’ leaders is an opportunity for a breakthrough.“They have to do more.

I know what you want to do, you want to make sure that you know who we’re letting in.”Later, Trump asked a U.S. Coast Guard commander about trade, which he noted was “a very big subject” for him personally.“We’ve been taken advantage of for many, many years by bad trade deals,” Trump told the commander, who sheepishly replied, “Mr. President, from our perspective on the water … we don’t see any issues in terms of trade right now.”And throughout, Trump congratulated himself, telling the officers that the country is doing exceptionally well on his watch.“I hope that you’ll take solace in knowing that all of the American families you hold so close to your heart are all doing well,” he said. “The nation’s doing well economically, better than anybody in the world.” He later told reporters, “Nobody’s done more for the military than me.”Indeed, asked what he was thankful for this Thanksgiving, Trump cited his “great family” as well as himself.“I made a tremendous difference in this country,” he said.","dateModified":"2018-11-23T03:00:56.883Z","datePublished":"2018-11-23T02:33:00.000Z","headline":"Trump tells troops he’s thankful for what he’s done for the U.S. and rails against courts and migrants","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e3dd7ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2F6c%2F78f1c61e0e794f252a6752e84812%2Fla-lb-media-apphoto-trump-20181122-181951","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#trump-tells-troops-hes-thankful-for-what-hes-done-for-the-u-s-and-rails-against-courts-and-migrants"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"VideoPresident Trump delivered a Thanksgiving message to American service members on duty around the world, telling them by telephone, \"Your courage truly inspires us.\"Trump told members of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and U.S. Coast Guard that he and First Lady Melania Trump wanted to express their \"profound gratitude.\"Trump is spending the holiday in Palm Beach, Fla., at his private Mar-a-Lago Club again this year.He started Thursday morning tweeting as part of his extraordinary public dispute with Chief Justice John Roberts.

David Valadao had survived a close shave and was destined to return to Washington for his fourth term.But on Wednesday, when Fresno County announced its latest vote totals, the Hanford Republican found himself in an increasingly harrowing cliffhanger against Democrat TJ Cox, with his lead in the Central Valley district shrunken to 447 votes. Thousands remain to be counted.Valadao, a repeated Democratic target, finished election night with a lead of nearly 4,440 votes. Cox, an engineer and a business owner who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2006, has steadily gained ground in the 21st Congressional District ever since.The trend is consistent with historic patterns showing Republicans in California tend to vote early and Democrats later, meaning their mail ballots continue to stream in past election day. Under California law, ballots postmarked up to midnight on Nov. 6 will be counted.Democrats have already picked up six House seats in California. They ousted Reps. Dana Rohrabacher, Mimi Walters, Steve Knight and Jeff Denham and won the seats of retiring Reps. Ed Royce and Darrell Issa.All six represented districts that backed Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in 2016.Valadao was the seventh California Republican in a district Clinton won, though his previous successes – he last won reelection by a 14-point margin – suggested his ouster was a longer shot for Democrats.If Cox prevails, it would give Democrats a 40-seat gain nationwide, far more than the 23 seats needed to take control when Congress reconvenes in January.","dateModified":"2018-11-22T01:56:15.193Z","datePublished":"2018-11-22T00:55:00.000Z","headline":"Republican David Valadao’s lead slips to 447 votes over Democrat TJ Cox in still-undecided Central Valley House race","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b49dfe1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2046x1151+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb2%2F27%2Fd7564b842d85654a9cf0d9d62a69%2Fla-lb-media-la-me-valadao-20181121-165127","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Mark Z.

Cox holds a lopsided lead in Kern County, but Valadao remains ahead in Fresno, Kings and Tulare counties.It is unclear how many thousands of ballots remain uncounted. The four counties have told the state that they still have nearly 70,000 ballots to tally. Many of them came from voters living outside the 21st District, so it’s difficult to estimate Valadao’s prospects for survival.The Nov. 6 midterm election results have been dismal for Republicans in California. The party has lost six of its 14 House seats in the state, leaving it with a tiny minority of the 53-seat delegation.Democrats unseated Reps.

Gen. Matthew Whitaker's appointment is unconstitutional and asking a federal judge to remove him.The suit, filed by Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, argues that Whitaker's appointment violates the Constitution because he has not been confirmed by the Senate.Whitaker was chief of staff to Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions and was elevated to the top job after Sessions was ousted by President Trump on Nov. 7.The Constitution's Appointments Clause requires that the Senate confirm all principal officials before they can serve in their office.The Justice Department released a legal opinion last week that said Whitaker's appointment would not violate the clause because he is serving in an acting capacity. The opinion concluded that Whitaker, even without Senate confirmation, may serve in an acting capacity because he has been at the department for more than a year at a “sufficiently senior pay level.”“President Trump is denying senators our constitutional obligation and opportunity to do our job: scrutinizing the nomination of our nation's top law enforcement official,” Blumenthal said in a statement. “The reason is simple: Whitaker would never pass the advice and consent test. In selecting a so-called ‘constitutional nobody' and thwarting every senator's constitutional duty, Trump leaves us no choice but to seek recourse through the courts.”The lawsuit comes days after a Washington lawyer challenged Whitaker's appointment in a pending Supreme Court case dealing with gun rights. The attorney, Thomas Goldstein, asked the high court to find that Whitaker's appointment is unconstitutional and replace him with Deputy Atty. Gen. Rod Rosenstein.Rosenstein, the second-ranking Justice Department official, has been confirmed by the Senate and had been overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Whitaker is now overseeing the investigation.The Justice Department issued a statement Monday defending Whitaker's appointment as “lawful” and said it comports with the Appointments Clause, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and legal precedent.“There are over 160 instances in American history in which non-Senate confirmed persons performed, on a temporary basis, the duties of a Senate-confirmed position,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. “To suggest otherwise is to ignore centuries of practice and precedent.”","dateModified":"2018-11-19T17:21:10.067Z","datePublished":"2018-11-19T17:06:00.000Z","headline":"Democratic senators sue over Whitaker’s appointment as acting attorney general","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8c6373d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+158/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffd%2Fa6%2F72004a1c5c1265705e04ff256d3d%2Fla-lb-media-afp-getty-files-us-politics-justice-whitaker-20181119-090443","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#democratic-senators-sue-over-whitakers-appointment-as-acting-attorney-general"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageFlorida's Republican Gov.

Nancy Pelosi's bid for speaker of the House and will make campaign finance reform her top priority when she enters the chamber in January.“I'm going to continue to have conversations, but so far I feel like Leader Pelosi is definitely making the things that were a priority to the families that elected me her priorities, including announcing her support for campaign finance reform and anti-corruption as HR1,\" Porter said in her first public appearance since being declared the winner in California’s 45th Congressional District on Thursday evening. “It means a lot to me that she is a Californian. She understands our state,” Porter added. “When we talk about environmental protections, this is a person who understands as a Californian how fragile our environment is and what's at risk in things like drilling off our coasts.\"Porter, a law professor at UC Irvine, defeated two-term Republican Rep. Mimi Walters. The 45th District, covering inland Orange County, has never been represented by a Democrat.Porter became the third Democrat to claim a Republican-held seat in Orange County, following the victories of Harley Rouda in the 48th District and Mike Levin in the 49th. A fourth, Gil Cisneros, is running slightly ahead of his Republican opponent in the race for the open seat in the 39th District, which extends into Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties.Porter attributed the massive political shift in the county, for decades a conservative stronghold, to increased levels of political engagement. \"Folks here care about education, they care about the environment, they believe climate change is real, they want healthcare that protects preexisting conditions, they want a tax system that doesn't punish California, they want our schools and places of worship to be safe from gun violence,\" she said.\"Those are the issues we campaigned on, and to the extent that Donald Trump and Mimi Walters were on the wrong side of those issues, the voters have made clear what direction they want us to go.\"Porter was flying back from the East Coast when her race was called, she said. She turned on her phone to find 167 text messages from friends and supporters.Among them was Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who was one of Porter’s teachers in law school and with whom she has remained close. The pair spoke via FaceTime this morning, she said.","dateModified":"2018-11-16T22:54:19.101Z","datePublished":"2018-11-16T22:31:00.000Z","headline":"Congresswoman-elect Katie Porter says she will support Rep.

Rick Scott and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson separated by less than 13,000 votes.But the highly watched contest for governor between Republican Ron DeSantis and Democrat Andrew Gillum appeared to be over, with a machine recount showing DeSantis with a large enough advantage over Gillum to avoid a hand recount in that race.Gillum, who conceded the contest on election night only to retract his concession later, said in a statement that “it is not over until every legally casted vote is counted.”The recount so far has been fraught with problems. One large Democratic stronghold in South Florida was unable to finish its machine recount by the Thursday deadline due to machines breaking down. A federal judge rejected a request to extend the recount deadline.“We gave a heroic effort,” said Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher. If the county had three or four more hours, it would have made the deadline to recount ballots in the Senate race, she said.Meanwhile, election officials in another urban county in the Tampa Bay area decided against turning in the results of their machine recount, which came up with 846 fewer votes than originally counted. Media in South Florida reported that Broward County finished its machine recount but missed the deadline by a few minutes.Counties were ordered last weekend to do a machine recount of three statewide races because the margins were so tight. The next stage is a manual review of ballots that were not counted by machines to see whether there is a way to figure out voter intent.Scott called on Nelson to end the recount battle.It’s time for Nelson “to respect the will of the voters and graciously bring this process to an end rather than proceed with yet another count of the votes — which will yield the same result and bring more embarrassment to the state that we both love and have served,” the governor said in a statement.The recount has triggered multiple lawsuits, many of them filed by Nelson and Democrats. The legal battles drew the ire of U.S. District Judge Mark E. Walker, who slammed the state for repeatedly failing to anticipate election problems. He also said the state law on recounts appears to violate the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that decided the presidency in 2000.“We have been the laughingstock of the world, election after election, and we chose not to fix this,” Walker said during a morning hearing.Walker vented his anger at state lawmakers and Palm Beach County officials, saying they should have made sure they had enough equipment in place to handle this kind of a recount. But he said he could not extend the recount deadline because he did not know when Palm Beach County would finish its work.“This court must be able to craft a remedy with knowledge that it will not prove futile,” Walker wrote in his ruling turning down the request from Democrats. “It cannot do so on this record. This court does not and will not fashion a remedy in the dark.”The overarching problem was created by the Florida Legislature, which Walker said passed a recount law that appears to run afoul of the 2000 Bush vs. Gore decision by locking in procedures that do not allow for potential problems.A total of six election-related lawsuits are pending in federal court in Tallahassee as well at least one lawsuit filed in state court.Walker also ordered that voters be given until 5 p.m. Saturday to show a valid identification and fix their ballots if they have not been counted due to mismatched signatures. Republicans appealed the ruling, but an appeals court turned down the request.State officials testified that nearly 4,000 mailed-in ballots were set aside because local officials decided the signatures on the envelopes did not match the signatures on file. If those voters can prove their identity, their votes will be counted and included in final official returns due from each county by noon Sunday.Walker was asked by Democrats to require local officials to provide a list of people whose ballots were rejected. But the judge appointed by President Obama refused the request, calling it “inappropriate.”Under state law, a hand review is required with races that have a margin of 0.25 percentage points or less. A state website put the unofficial results showing Scott ahead of Nelson by 0.15 percentage points. The margin between DeSantis and Gillum was at 0.41 points.The margin between Scott and Nelson had not changed much in the last few days, conceded Marc Elias, an attorney working for Nelson’s campaign. But he said that he expected the vote tally to shrink due to the hand recount and the ruling on signatures.The developments fueled frustrations among Democrats and Republicans alike. Democrats want state officials to do whatever it takes to make sure every eligible vote is counted. Republicans, including President Trump, have argued without evidence that voter fraud threatens to steal races from the GOP.","dateModified":"2018-11-16T02:52:39.978Z","datePublished":"2018-11-16T02:27:00.000Z","headline":"Bitter battle for Senate seat in Florida goes to hand recount","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3f126d6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+130/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1b%2Fc7%2F9f0a00e348ab1d4d8b12c3224bca%2Fla-lb-media-ap18319737405863-20181115-182500","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#bitter-battle-for-senate-seat-in-florida-goes-to-hand-recount"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageDemocrat Gil Cisneros pulled ahead of Republican Young Kim in one of California’s undecided congressional races Thursday, an ominous sign for a GOP already reeling from its loss of four House seats in the state.In updated vote counts released by the registrars for Orange and San Bernardino counties, Kim fell 941 votes behind Cisneros in the contest to succeed Republican Rep.

The full House votes on Jan. 3 to elect a new speaker.During her remarks, Pelosi touted the size of the Democratic victory in the midterms, which she called \"almost a tsunami.\" With a few races still to be decided, Democrats are poised to pick up close to 40 seats in the chamber.Pelosi called that \"the biggest victory for the Democrats since 1974, when the Watergate babies came in.\"Pelosi's comments come as she faces solid opposition from at least 17 Democrats, setting the stage for a battle over who will ascend to one of the most powerful positions in Washington.After a campaign in which some Democrats prevailed in competitive districts by promising to oppose her, a coalition of incumbents and newly elected members has denied her a smooth path to the speakership.The defections, if they stand, would leave Pelosi, who has led the Democrats for more than 15 years, several votes short of the 218 she would need when the full House votes for speaker Jan. 3. However, no Democrat has stepped forward to run against her for a job she held from 2007 through 2010.Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) told reporters Wednesday that she's being encouraged to stand for speaker if Pelosi doesn't have the votes.In an interview with the Washington Post on Thursday, she said she has been \"overwhelmed\" by the support from many of her colleagues for her possible entry into the race for House speaker.\"Over the last 12 hours, I've been overwhelmed by the amount of support I've received,\" Fudge said, adding that there are \"probably closer to 30\" Democrats who have privately signaled that they are willing to oppose Pelosi.\"Things could change rapidly,\" Fudge said.Fudge, 66, a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, said she is building a diverse coalition as she mulls a speaker run, talking with allies in the caucus, moderate Democrats and newly elected members.To this point, Pelosi has enjoyed the strong backing of the Congressional Black Caucus.On Thursday, Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), one of its members, wrote a letter to colleagues praising her \"insight, fortitude and strategic thinking\" and urging support for her speakership bid.Former Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr., an African American who is contemplating a 2020 presidential bid, also voiced support for Pelosi, praising her in a tweet as \"an architect of the recent midterm success.\"Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), a leader of the resistance to Pelosi, said during an interview on CNN on Thursday that Fudge is \"the kind of new leader that we need in this party.\"\"She's in touch with middle America. She understands what the American people want. She's a next-generation leader that people will look to and say, 'That's the future of our party, that's the future of our country, and that's exactly the kind of leader that I want to see as our next speaker.\"Wagner reports for the Washington Post.

Mimi Walters.“I want you to make sure every phone is called and every door is knocked,” he told the crowd of about 80 volunteers. “There has never been a more important election.”Both Bauman and his nephew, California Democratic Party Chairman Eric Bauman, were  interrupted by yells from Trump supporters coming from an adjoining hillside.“We love Trump,” the voice cried out.“We love him too, he makes great fodder,” the younger Bauman retorted, before introducing Porter.Porter, a UC Irvine law professor and first-time candidate, acknowledged the uphill battle some of her canvassers might face in this more conservative end of the long-red Orange County district.“I know it’s going to be tough out there,” she said, motioning to the hillside. But she said the attacks meant the other side viewed her campaign as a significant threat.“This election is going to be close,” she said. “If we don’t fight all the way to the finish line, until 8 o’clock on Tuesday, this could slip away.”Bowzer then took to a keyboard piano to lead the crowd in a reworded rendition of the song “Good Night Sweetheart”: “Good night, Mimi Walters,” he crooned.A woman in a black tank top, jeans and flip flops holding a cup of coffee later joined the crowd with her two sons, 17 and 14, the younger one wearing a Trump 2016 T-shirt.She declined to give her name, saying she was concerned about being attacked, but said she lived up the hill and said she had been the one yelling. She said she was encouraging her sons to talk to people on both sides and make up their own minds.“We need to have a government that runs the way government teachers are telling kids it’s supposed to be run,” said the woman, a retired registered dental assistant who voted early for Mimi Walters. Referring to Democrats, she said: “They’ve had control over all these years and California’s gone to crap.”Among those canvassing was Stacie Campbell, 37, who was at the launch with her husband Jerome and three children, the youngest of whom was 2 months old.Campbell, a Mission Viejo resident who runs a business, had never canvassed or volunteered for campaigns before, and her husband is a French citizen and unable to vote. She said they had been talking to their children — the older ones are 5 and 2 — about the presidency and the government since Trump’s election. Together, they worked on homemade Katie Porter lawn signs and put them up around town.“This is the first time it’s felt like a big deal and there isn’t a president up for election,” she said.Because her city is a mix of conservatives and liberals — her next-door neighbor is an NRA-supporting Republican — she the race felt more urgent here.“It makes the election really cutthroat,” said Campbell, an independent who doesn’t vote along party lines — in fact, she thought she may have voted for Walters in the past. “When it’s so close and so much is at stake, we figured it was finally time to bite the bullet,” she said about coming out to volunteer for Porter.","dateModified":"2018-11-05T17:19:51.726Z","datePublished":"2018-11-05T04:22:00.000Z","headline":"‘It’s going to be tough out there’","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7a81b5a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+192/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F84%2Fef%2Fbc4be5a64a1bfb8ba1affdf70890%2Fla-lb-media-katieportershanana-20181104-202023","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#its-going-to-be-tough-out-there"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageGil Cisneros got on stage with comedian Chelsea Handler on Sunday afternoon, urging his supporters to help him reach as many voters as possible to get out the vote in the 39th Congressional District, where he’s hoping to snag a seat held by retiring Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton).“This election really is going to come down to the wire,” he said. Within the hour, Cisneros was knocking on doors in a nearby Buena Park neighborhood full of tidy ranch-style homes with neatly trimmed lawns and within earshot of roller-coaster screams emanating from Knott’s Berry Farm. TweetAt one, he introduced himself to Nicolas Cervantes, a 64-year-old Democrat who’s voted in only two of the last five elections. “I’ve already sent in my vote, and my daughter and son, too,” Cervantes said in Spanish as he took a break from yard work to hang over his chain link fence. His wife, Julia, said she’ll go to the polls Tuesday.“Do we have your vote?” asked Cisneros in English.“Oh, cien por ciento,” Cervantes responded in Spanish, “100%.”“Every vote is going to count in this election,” Cisneros staffer Tom Rivera replied in Spanish.  TweetOne street over, Laura Cabaruvias and Max Molina, both 27, greeted Cisneros with two small dogs underfoot. Both said they were supporting Cisneros, but neither had voted yet. Molina was waiting to turn in his mail ballot, which was already filled out.“If you’ve got it done, we can take it now,” Cisneros said. (Under a fairly new state law, campaigns and other organizations — not just family members — can collect ballots and turn them in for voters.)“Thank you, that will save me a trip. I knew I was going to be pretty busy the next couple days,” said Molina, as he licked the envelope, sealed and signed it.Nick Delvillar, 28, took a break from watching the Rams lose to the New Orleans Saints to speak with Cisneros, whom he instantly recognized from the campaign’s TV commercials.“I’ve gotten like 10 calls from you guys,” Delvillar said, “I told them I’m voting for you.”Cisneros peeked in and pointed at another young man there.“What about him?” he asked.“He’s voting for you, too.” Delvillar shut the screen door, and Cisneros walked on to the next door.Young Kim’s campaign did not give her detailed schedule of Sunday events to The Times despite requests.","dateModified":"2018-11-05T04:04:06.279Z","datePublished":"2018-11-05T03:49:00.000Z","headline":"In a bid to turn out infrequent voters, Gil Cisneros tries house visits in Buena Park","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3ff1c77/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x576+0+91/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FDrMsNBtU4AACaDl.jpg","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Christine Mai-Duc"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#in-a-bid-to-turn-out-infrequent-voters-gil-cisneros-tries-house-visits-in-buena-park"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Tweet","dateModified":"2018-11-05T02:21:19.005Z","datePublished":"2018-11-05T01:45:00.000Z","headline":"Knocking on 97 doors per minute","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#knocking-on-97-doors-per-minute"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Tweet","dateModified":"2018-11-05T01:27:48.276Z","datePublished":"2018-11-05T01:35:54.822Z","headline":"Vote for Our Lives rally at UC Irvine","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#vote-for-our-lives-rally-at-uc-irvine"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Water for farmers and support for local businesses were among the top issues for Republicans gathered in Modesto on Sunday at a campaign rally for Congressman Jeff Denham and gubernatorial candidate John Cox.

Jeff Denham and California gubernatorial candidate John Cox on Sunday called for a repeal of the state’s gas tax increase and underscored the need to expand roads and add jobs.Stumping in Modesto, where Cox’s bus made a stop at Denham’s campaign headquarters, the two made little mention of President Trump in an area where Democrats hold a slight edge in registered voters. Their most passionate pleas were to bring water to Central Valley farmers and to build not a wall along the border with Mexico but greater storage capacity.“We need to have our water, and we need to make sure that we have a candidate that will fight for the Valley,” Denham said.Denham, 51, is facing a tight race against Democrat Josh Harder, 32, in a district targeted by national Democrats. Harder supporters have flooded into the Valley over the weekend from across the state to knock on doors and hand out fliers in hopes of flipping the House. TweetHarder, a former venture capitalist who was born and raised in the district, has stressed healthcare, citing Denham’s vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act as the reason for his return home and his first run for Congress.But on Sunday, the two Republicans seized on his outside support to cast the 2018 election as a battle between the liberal values of the Bay Area and the conservative way of life of rural California. Cox, 63, is facing his own opponent with ties to the Bay, Democrat Gavin Newsom, the state’s two-term lieutenant governor and a former San Francisco mayor.“Who are we fighting? The San Francisco values,” Cox said, as dozens booed at the city’s mention. “Take a look at that city. It used to be a wonderful city. It was run by my opponent – I would say run into the ground.”The battle cry was not enough for some supporters who wanted them to rally behind Trump. “I would love to hear somebody say something positive about the president,” yelled out a woman as they wrapped up. “Build the wall,” another shouted.","dateModified":"2018-11-05T02:09:19.263Z","datePublished":"2018-11-05T01:16:00.000Z","headline":"In this Central Valley district, candidates don’t mention Trump or his wall.

Steve Knight of Palmdale, drafted “Veronica Mars” and “The Good Place” star Kristen Bell to campaign with her Sunday in Simi Valley.Bell’s appearance at a strip-mall rally of about 150 canvassers for Hill was the highlight of a whirlwind day of campaigning in one of America’s most competitive House races in Tuesday’s midterm elections — at least on the Democratic side (Knight had no public schedule).Bell told the crowd of volunteers that she’d known Hill for more than a decade through her support for PATH, a Los Angeles nonprofit that provides services to the homeless. Hill, 31, was one of PATH’s top executives when she left to run for Congress.“I actually said to myself at one point, I was like, ‘Oh my goodness, is she the real-life Veronica Mars?’” Bell told the crowd from a platform outside a bustling Hill campaign office. “Because truly she’s always fought for the underdog.”Hill said she expected nearly 3,000 volunteers to walk door-to-door Sunday across the state’s 25th Congressional District, which covers Simi Valley, Porter Ranch, Santa Clarita, Palmdale and southern Lancaster.“We’re knocking on doors that have never been knocked on before,” Hill told the group.Hill, who also campaigned Sunday with filmmaker Rory Kennedy, was headed later to a Chatsworth house party, then a picnic and two rallies in the Antelope Valley.Knight’s only public event over the weekend was a sunrise visit Saturday to the starting line of the Santa Clarita Marathon.Knight, 51, said he would have a busy weekend schedule, including a Day of the Dead celebration and a veterans ball, but his campaign declined to release locations for any events except the marathon.

The deadline to register to vote in Tuesday's election passed early last month. The investigation was launched Saturday evening, according to Kemp's office, and was made public early Sunday.By mid-morning, the headline \"After Failed Hacking Attempt, SOS Launches Investigation Into Georgia Democratic Party\" sat front and center on the secretary of state's government website - directly beneath a voter's guide to polling locations.\"While we cannot comment on the specifics of an ongoing investigation, I can confirm that the Democratic Party of Georgia is under investigation for possible cyber crimes,\" Kemp's press secretary, Candice Broce, was quoted saying in the statement. \"We can also confirm that no personal data was breached and our system remains secure.\"The office said it had contacted the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security about the hacking attempt. The FBI could not be immediately reached for information. A DHS spokeswoman said in an emailed statement, \"The State of Georgia has notified us of this issue. We defer to the State for further details.\"Abrams, who is polling almost neck-and-neck with Kemp, told CNN on Sunday that she had been unaware of her opponent's investigation into her party.\"He is desperate to turn the conversation away from his failures, from his refusal to honor his commitments, and from the fact that he's part of a nationwide system of voter suppression,\" she said.Voting rights has become a major issue in the campaign, which has drawn national attention because Abrams, 44, if elected, would become the nation's first black female governor.Abrams, who four years ago started a nonprofit group whose goal was to sign up hundreds of thousands of unregistered people of color, has clashed repeatedly with Kemp, whom she calls \"the architect of voter suppression.\" Kemp investigated the group, which Abrams is no longer affiliated with, for fraud but found no wrongdoing.Kemp, 55, who has argued that the policies are aimed at preventing voter fraud, also has been criticized for having purged more than a million voters from the rolls during the past year. He has rejected calls, including one from former President Jimmy Carter, that he should step down as the state's top elections official while he is running for governor.Although lawmakers and elections officials in Republican-controlled states have cited concerns about cheating to enact strict voter registration and identification laws, there is no evidence of widespread fraud in the United States.Kemp's office came under intense scrutiny last month, when the Associated Press reported that more than 53,000 voter registration applications - 70% of them from African Americans - had been held up because the identification information was not an \"exact match\" to other state records, because of discrepancies such as a dropped hyphen in a person's name.On Friday a federal judge ordered the state to immediately stop using the rule, saying it would likely lead to violating the voting rights of a large number of people.

He was born 10 weeks premature.”David was in and out of hospitals for two years before he recovered with the help of his family’s health insurance, and on Saturday he was among hundreds of volunteers who made their way across the state to knock on doors for the Harder campaign.Healthcare, immigration and jobs are among the top issues Harder has sought to underscore in the 10th Congressional District, where nearly 18% of people live below the poverty level, roughly 5% have no health insurance and more than 40% are Latino.Polls show Harder, 32, in a virtual tie with the three-term incumbent. The district is one that has been heavily targeted by Democrats in an effort to flip the house. His campaign staffers called their canvassing efforts on Saturday the largest in any congressional district nationwide.At a packed warehouse in Modesto, cars lined the streets and businesses put up makeshift “no parking” signs. At a home in Turlock, morning canvassers formed a crowd that filled a spacious backyard and stretched onto the street. TweetMany came in from the Bay Area, a factor that Denham has seized on as he has sought to portray Harder as an outsider. But Harder sought to dispel that notion, referring to his great-great grandfather, who he said settled in the area after arriving on a wagon five generations ago.“I love this district,” he said to cheers from the crowd. The antidote to the political violence and the hate the nation seen the last few weeks, he said, “is what we’re doing right here, talking to our friends, neighbors and the people we love about the issues and how much is at stake here in the next four days.”It was a message that has resonated with volunteers like Jessica Gunderson, who handles government relations for a cannabis company in Oakland and visited the district for the first time on Saturday.“Changing the power dynamic in Washington and protecting Californians” were why she made the trip, she said. A lot of her conversations revolved around President Trump and the need to provide a check on his power, she said.But, she said, “I also learned a lot today from getting outside my bubble.”","dateModified":"2018-11-04T05:48:40.593Z","datePublished":"2018-11-04T02:50:00.000Z","headline":"Democrat Josh Harder emphasizes his opponent’s GOP healthcare vote","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a12511b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2016x1134+0+189/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2F68%2Fab9fe972d32b65cbd21ec2afdfbb%2Fla-lb-media-unnamed-1-20181103-182911","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Jazmine Ulloa"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#democrat-josh-harder-emphasizes-his-opponents-gop-healthcare-vote"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageJason Gates doesn’t have a TV at home, but it’s still been difficult for him to avoid what seems to be wall-to-wall political campaigning ahead of next week’s midterm election.His mailbox has been stuffed daily with campaign mailers — his three young kids sometimes draw on them before they all go into the trash — and he’s barraged by ads on social media sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Nextdoor.No matter.

Mayor Eric Garcetti stopped by Escondido to help Democratic congressional candidate Ammar Campa-Najjar kick off his get-out-the-vote push Saturday. Campa-Najjar is challenging Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) for his seat in the conservative 50th Congressional District.Recent polls have showed the gap narrowing between the 29-year-old first-time candidate and the five-term incumbent, who was indicted in August on charges of campaign finance violations. Hunter still holds a narrow lead, but it is within the margin of error.In his remarks to the volunteers, who filled the cramped campaign headquarters, Garcetti spoke about the importance of electing someone who values unity over self-preservation.“You want someone who understands how Washington works but brings an outsider’s perspective and his own hardships that he’s overcome,” Garcetti said in an interview after his speech. “I think that that’s really compelling to Americans who are sick and tired of entitled congressmen like Duncan Hunter.”Given how close the race is, Campa-Najjar stressed that the next three days could be the difference, saying that he wanted to knock on 70,000 doors in that time.His campaign has benefited from an influx of youthful canvassers from outside the district, as representatives of both California Young Democrats and UCLA’s Bruin Democrats set out alongside retired nurses, teachers and campaign workers.After working phone banks across congressional districts closer to home, such as the 48th and 25th, the college organization wanted to make a big canvassing push, said N.J. Omorogieva, 21, a fourth-year student at UCLA and president of the Bruin Democrats.Eleven students made the trip down to San Diego County to canvass for the candidate.“Students … want to be part of something bigger than their campus,” Omorogieva said. “We have a lot of people who are not from California who are here today, and they’re like, ‘We want to make an impact.’ ”","dateModified":"2018-11-04T04:31:41.638Z","datePublished":"2018-11-04T01:00:00.000Z","headline":"Ammar Campa-Najjar gets a hand from Eric Garcetti in the 50th District","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a4453ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+192/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2a%2F81%2Fdd93db3401e1ba1a160af7b3a18e%2Fla-lb-media-garcetticampa-20181103-174331","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Maya Sweedler"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#ammar-campa-najjar-gets-a-hand-from-eric-garcetti-in-the-50th-district"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImagePatricia and Michael Hayes came to a Sears parking lot in Buena Park to vote in person Saturday afternoon, their grandson Terrence in tow. Michael said the most important issues driving his congressional vote as a retiree were protecting Social Security, Healthcare, and Medicare. \"There is a movement, I think, on the Republican side to do away with it,\" he said. \"Especially for people with preexisting injuries,\" his wife, Patricia Hayes, chimed in.The Hayes are registered Democrats but, says Michael, \"it doesn't necessarily mean that you have to vote Democrat.\"This year, however, he felt it was important to support a Democrat for Congress.

Jeff Denham and Democrat Josh Harder are locked in one of the most intense races in California.Denham, 51, has strong support from farmers who depend on farmworkers to pick their crops; the Turlock congressman has tried to toe the middle line on immigration. But members of the United Farm Workers union and United We Dream Action, a national immigrant rights group, are making a final push for Harder, contending that Denham mostly sides with his party on strict immigration policies that hurt their communities.Out in Ceres, south of Modesto, Cristina Escobedo, 41, and Cristal Reyes, 16, had talked to nearly 20 people before noon. A volunteer with United Farm Workers, Escobedo has harvested almonds and grapes for two decades and fought for farmworkers’ rights for five.This year, she said, her efforts are all in the name of her 23-year-old daughter, Fabiola, whose fate she says hangs in the balance with President Trump’s attacks on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which protects from deportation young people who were brought to the country illegally as children and meet other requirements. She urged voters to head to the polls even as she can’t cast a vote herself, telling anyone who would open the door about Fabiola.“We’re tired of being attacked,” she told residents. TweetTheir final pleas could make a difference in a race in which polls show Denham and Harder, 32, in a virtual tie. The race is also one of several across the state that reflect the long-running tension among Republicans over immigration in California.The 10th District, which stretches across Stanislaus County and southern San Joaquin County, has a slight edge on Democratic voters, and Latinos — who lean Democratic — make up more than 40% of the population. But their low voter turnout has helped keep the seat in Republican hands.“There are still lots of undecided voters, and people are getting flooded and confused by ads,” Escobedo said.Not everyone wanted to hear the message. Hanging out in the garage with his wife, Ethan Lopez, 22, took their fliers but said he had already voted by mail. Lopez said he was against tighter gun control restrictions and has long leaned Republican in a blue state where he doesn’t always feel heard.“I don’t really like Jeff Denham, but I want Republicans to remain in control of the House,” he said.","dateModified":"2018-11-04T00:07:57.383Z","datePublished":"2018-11-03T23:12:00.000Z","headline":"‘We are tired of being attacked’: Farmworkers and immigrant rights activists make a final push to flip the House","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dc6689e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2016x1134+0+189/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F07%2F4e%2F52704573a04e3a734e9536caf06c%2Fla-lb-media-unnamed-20181103-135731","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Jazmine Ulloa"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#we-are-tired-of-being-attacked-farmworkers-and-immigrant-rights-activists-make-a-final-push-to-flip-the-house"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageIt’s been a few years since Marylee and Grayson Sanders have volunteered for political campaigns — her last was for the younger Bush, his for Eisenhower, passing out “I like Ike” signs in the 1950s.Saturday morning, they spent hours making hundreds of calls at the Irvine campaign headquarters of Rep.

But the wave of mail bombs targeting prominent Democrats this week has angered and dismayed some of the people affected personally by past acts of political violence in the United States.In the past 60 years alone, there have been scores of deadly incidents motivated by ideology. The perpetrators range from Ku Klux Klan racists to members of the far-left Weather Underground to antiabortion extremists who killed abortion-providing doctors.The mail-bomb scare has reopened old wounds for Lisa McNair, whose life was shaped by a deadly blast that occurred a year before she was born: the Klan bombing that killed four black girls at 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, on Sept. 15, 1963. Her sister, Denise, just 11 years old, was the youngest victim.\"It's like, 'Ugh, again.' When are we going to get this right?\" McNair said. \"It's been 55 years since Denise was killed. Why do we keep going there in America? Why do we keep going there as a world and human beings?\"The United States, founded in a war that began as a political rebellion, likes to pride itself on a political system that discourages violence and emphasizes dialogue — no matter how loud and contentious. But in times of deep division throughout American history, angry words have occasionally turned to angry acts and left devastated citizens in their wake.Some of those directly affected by political violence say they struggle to remain optimistic in this contentious era. Others say their perspectives have evolved over time, and they believe they have insights to share.The Rev. Rob Schenck was a fiery leader in the antiabortion movement 20 years ago when an extremist's bullet killed abortion provider Dr. Barnett Slepian as he heated soup in the kitchen of his home outside Buffalo, New York.The killing changed Schenck. He concluded that the language of his cause — \"innocent, deliberately hyperbolic rhetoric meant to drive home a point\"— produced deadly consequences.Schenck said he'd thought in recent weeks about sending a memo to President Trump, to convey the lesson he'd learned firsthand and recommend a toning down of vitriolic oratory.\"The president may honestly believe that no one who supports him is capable of acting with lethal violence, but the sad fact is he can never know that,\" Schenck said.Hearing about the pipe bombs \"sickened\" him.\"My first thought was, 'Here we go again.' In the worst possible way,\" he said.Another abortion provider, Dr. George Tiller, was shot dead by an abortion opponent in Wichita, Kan., in 2009.One of Tiller's colleagues, Julie Burkhart, operates abortion clinics in Wichita, Oklahoma City and Seattle. She says the mail-bomb scare has prompted her to double check security measures.\"I'm scared to death for this country,\" Burkhart said in a telephone interview.\"The gulf between Republicans and Democrats, pro-choice and anti-choice — it's a huge canyon now,\" she said. \"There's all this pent-up anger and frustration, and we're going to be taking it out on each other even more.\"Similar concerns came from U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican wounded last year by a gunman who attacked a GOP baseball practice. He lamented \"the disturbing frequency of politically motivated threats and violence.\"\"Too many Americans are becoming isolated and obsessed by what divides us,\" Scalise wrote in an opinion piece for Fox News. \"If we are to stem the tide of violence and violent rhetoric, then it is crucial we all do our part to break down the divisions in our country and reach out to those with different beliefs than our own.\"Optimism is elusive for Andrea Chamblee, the widow of sports writer John McNamara. He was one of five employees of The Capital newspaper in Annapolis, Md., who were killed in June by a gunman with a history of harassing the paper's journalists.\"We allow ourselves to be misrepresented by politicians who are too divided and blinded by hatred, greed and self-interest to work together,\" she said. \"We're making it harder for people in the middle to be heard, not easier, and I don't see how it can get any better.\"The mail-bomb scare felt unnervingly familiar to Mohamed Omar. He is executive director of the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center, a mosque in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington that was attacked by a pipe bomb in August 2017.The center was bombed just before morning prayers when the attackers broke a window to the imam's office and threw a pipe bomb containing black powder inside, sparking a fire that caused extensive damage. Three men from Illinois were charged in the attack; according to charges, one of them said the purpose was to \"scare\" Muslims out of the United States.Omar said the new mail-bomb case and the attack on his mosque were both intended to \"create fear and terrorize people.\"\"It's very difficult for us to go through what we went through — and now it's more difficult. It's becoming the norm,\" he said. \"Nobody died. But the hope died and the sense of security died.\"Cleve Jones' close encounter with political violence came in 1978. Working as a student intern, he returned from lunch to find the bloody body of his boss, San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk, on the floor, shot several times by former Supervisor Dan White in a double assassination that also killed Mayor George Moscone. Milk was a prominent gay-rights activist, and Jones saw him as a father figure.\"I had never seen a dead person before,\" Jones, 64, said in a phone interview Thursday. \"The sheer horror of seeing up close what bullets do to flesh and bone and brain ... I think I was in shock for months.\"Jones says news of the pipe bombs — coming after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the constant calls by Trump to discredit the media, and deadly clashes last year at a white nationalists' rally in Charlottesville, Virginia — serves as another reminder of the violence he experienced.\"It's just very real to me, and it just makes me want to take people by the shoulders and shake them and scream at them, 'Don't you see where this is going?'\" Jones said.Pam Simon also experienced traumatic violence firsthand . She's a survivor of the 2011 rampage outside an Arizona grocery store where a gunman killed six people and wounded then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 12 others.Simon, a Giffords staffer who was shot in the wrist and chest, remembers the political atmosphere growing sour in the years preceding the shooting. She recalled Giffords getting booed at public meetings, and her office being vandalized after she voted for President Obama's healthcare overhaul.\"I remember a sinking feeling in my stomach, thinking, 'What's happening in this country?'\" Simon said.There was a brief call for more political civility immediately after the Arizona attack.\"After that moment of self-reflection, it seems to have gotten worse,\" Simon said.While some incidents of political violence quickly fade from public awareness, others have been memorialized.In Oklahoma City, for example, there's an outdoor memorial and a museum commemorating the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, which killed 168 people.In Birmingham, the 16th Street Baptist Church is a somber tourist attraction now, and just one of the convicted bombers remains alive in prison. But echoes of the crime still follow the McNair family.\"That will be something we will always carry, and it will be in our family,\" said Lisa McNair \"It will never leave us.\"","dateModified":"2018-10-26T16:08:30.868Z","datePublished":"2018-10-26T15:53:00.000Z","headline":"Bomb scare rattles those touched by past political violence","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cb37bc5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+126/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F27%2Fda%2Fa4ab277797225dbe0731721a46eb%2Fla-lb-media-ap18298771805569-20181026-084527","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#bomb-scare-rattles-those-touched-by-past-political-violence"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"RawHtmlModule","dateModified":"2018-10-26T15:58:46.654Z","datePublished":"2018-10-26T15:51:00.000Z","headline":"Watch live: President Trump to address bomb package investigation at Young Black Leadership Summit","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#watch-live-president-trump-to-address-bomb-package-investigation-at-young-black-leadership-summit"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageFormer Director of National Intelligence James R.

Dana Rohrabacher (R-Costa Mesa), raised more than $1 million, a sum six figures larger than what the incumbent amassed during the entire 2016 election.And over those 17 days, Mike Levin, hoping to capture a coastal Southern California seat left open by retiring Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista), wrote checks totaling more than his Republican opponent, Diane Harkey, has spent all year and still managed to have nearly six times as much cash in the bank as her.Five congressional candidates in California raised more than $1 million in that short period; only one, Rep. Devin Nunes of Tulare, is a Republican.Eleven of the 14 Republicans running for GOP-held seats in California, nine of them incumbents, were out-raised by their opponents. And half of the 14 reported having less in the bank than their competitors as of Oct. 17.Although Democrats nationally have broken one fundraising record after another this midterm election, the ongoing deluge of cash also has practical implications for candidates as they enter the home stretch in their campaign to flip GOP-held seats and take back control of Congress.With that level of resources, candidates can blanket TV and radio airwaves with ads, paper neighborhoods with mailers and launch robust get-out-the-vote efforts to boost turnout in key areas.That doesn’t mean GOP candidates won’t have other resources to count on. Conservative groups such as the Congressional Leadership Fund have already spent millions of dollars to boost Republicans in California races.But there are some indications that some big Democratic funders are ready to blunt their impact. On Thursday, as campaign finance reports continued to trickle in, a PAC created by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reported dropping more than $9.5 million on an eleventh-hour ad campaign to promote Hill and attack Rohrabacher.","dateModified":"2018-10-26T12:55:36.913Z","datePublished":"2018-10-26T10:00:00.000Z","headline":"17-day cash deluge boosts House candidates in Democrats’ final push to seize control of the House","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/62656f1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd3%2Fac%2F823e525d53da7867ce2b52a63a23%2Fla-1538790662-h4pfklxiv6-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Christine Mai-Duc"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#17-day-cash-deluge-boosts-house-candidates-in-democrats-final-push-to-seize-control-of-the-house"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe crowd outside campaign headquarters was boiling, the angry mood matching south Florida’s tropical heat, as Nancy Pelosi arrived to a shower of obscenities and crude insults in English and Spanish.With the doors locked and police standing guard, the Democratic congressional leader delivered her exhortation to dozens of volunteers — Make those phone calls, walk those precincts, the future of America’s at stake this midterm election! — as crisp and unruffled as her white pantsuit.Pelosi doesn’t care about the invective hurled her way, in whatever language.

Mnuchin pulled out of a major Saudi investment conference Thursday amid global pressure. However, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo also said the kingdom should be given more time to investigate before the U.S. lays any blame or considers action. Trump, who has insisted that more facts must be known before drawing conclusions about Khashoggi, did not say on what he based his statement regarding the writer's disappearance. He commented as he left Joint Base Andrews for a political trip to Montana. Asked if Khashoggi was dead, he said, “It certainly looks that way. Very sad.” While Turkish officials have accused Saudi Arabia of the murder in Istanbul of Khashoggi, a U.S.-based writer who has been critical of Saudi leaders, Trump has cautioned against a rush to judgment against an important Mideast ally. And Pompeo, just back from talks with Saudi and Turkish leaders, said earlier Thursday that the U.S. needed more facts before deciding “how, or if” to respond. ","dateModified":"2018-10-18T21:28:06.503Z","datePublished":"2018-10-18T21:09:00.000Z","headline":"Trump says it looks like Jamal Khashoggi is dead, threatens consequences","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c38a313/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+106/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F73%2Fd1%2F6954694c1f8f35fe193aeda91150%2Fla-lb-media-apphoto-trump32-20181018-140805","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#trump-says-it-looks-like-jamal-khashoggi-is-dead-threatens-consequences"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageIn their only scheduled joint appearance before election day, U.S. Sen.

Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday over DNA test results she released that indicate she has some Native American heritage, saying she is \"getting slammed\" over the assertion and branding it a \"scam and a lie.\"Trump called on his potential 2020 Democratic challenger to apologize. He claimed that even the Cherokee Nation \"denies her.\"Warren released the test results Monday in part to push back against Trump's longstanding taunts about her ancestry claims. The results provide some evidence of a Native American in her lineage, though the ancestor probably lived six to 10 generations ago, according to the analysis.An ancestor six generations removed would make Warren 1/64th Native American while an ancestor as much as 10 generations removed would render the Massachusetts Democrat only 1/1024th Native American, according to Blaine Bettinger, a genealogist and author who specializes in DNA evidence.Trump, who belittles Warren by calling her \"Pocahontas,\" seized on the conclusion in a series of tweets early Tuesday.\"Pocahontas (the bad version), sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren, is getting slammed,\" he wrote. \"She took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be 1/1024, far less than the average American. Now Cherokee Nation denies her, ‘DNA test is useless.’ Even they don't want her. Phony!\" TweetCherokee Nation Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin Jr. said Monday that DNA tests are useless in determining tribal citizenship, which is determined by tribal nations. Hoskin accused Warren of \"undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.\"Warren acknowledged in a tweet Monday that DNA and family history have nothing to do with tribal affiliation or citizenship, which is determined by tribal nations. \"I respect the distinction, & don't list myself as Native in the Senate,\" she said.\"Now that her claims of being of Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam and a lie, Elizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetrating this fraud against the American Public,\" Trump wrote in another tweet.He thanked the Cherokee Nation \"for revealing that Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, is a complete and total Fraud!\"Trump has offered over the summer to donate $1 million to Warren's favorite charity if a DNA test proved her Native American bloodline. On Monday, Trump first denied ever making such a promise.

The wealthy former government insider had been living in the United States in self-imposed exile.In an interview Wednesday with “Fox News @ Night,” Trump said he wanted to find out what happened to Khashoggi but appeared reluctant to consider blocking arms sales, citing economic reasons.“I think that would be hurting us,” Trump said. “We have jobs, we have a lot of things happening in this country. We have a country that's doing probably better economically than it's ever done before.”He continued: “Part of that is what we're doing with our defense systems and everybody's wanting them. And frankly I think that that would be a very, very tough pill to swallow for our country. I mean, you're affecting us and, you know, they're always quick to jump that way.”On his first international trip as president, Trump visited Saudi Arabia and announced $110 billion in proposed arms sales. The administration also relies on Saudi support for its Middle East agenda to counter Iranian influence, fight extremism and support an expected peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians.Earlier Wednesday, Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has reviewed U.S. intelligence on the case, said it was likely that Khashoggi was killed the day he walked into the consulate. Whatever took place, Corker said, “there was Saudi involvement” and “everything points to them.”More than 20 Republican and Democratic senators instructed Trump to order an investigation into Khashoggi's disappearance under legislation that authorizes imposition of sanctions for perpetrators of extrajudicial killings, torture or other gross human rights violations.Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) a longtime critic of the Saudi government, has said he'll try to force a vote in the Senate blocking U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said it would be time for the U.S. to rethink its relationship with Saudi Arabia if it turned out Khashoggi was lured to his death by the Saudis.Khashoggi had gone to the consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 to get paperwork he needed for his upcoming marriage while his Turkish fiancee waited outside. Turkish authorities have said he was killed by members of an elite Saudi “assassination squad,” an allegation the Saudi government has dismissed.The Washington Post reported Wednesday evening that U.S. intelligence intercepts outlined a Saudi plan to detain Khashoggi. The Post, citing anonymous U.S. officials familiar with the intelligence, said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered an operation to lure Khashoggi from his home in Virginia to Saudi Arabia and then detain him.","dateModified":"2018-10-11T16:10:12.983Z","datePublished":"2018-10-11T15:52:00.000Z","headline":"Trump raises economic concerns over halting Saudi arms sales","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/907fa03/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+2/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fec%2F93%2Fc23456b3acc7cbd5930fa3b762b6%2Fla-lb-media-afp-getty-files-us-turkey-saudi-politics-diplomacy-20181011-083607","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#trump-raises-economic-concerns-over-halting-saudi-arms-sales"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageFirst Lady Melania Trump said she could be “the most bullied person” in the world. She made the remark during a television interview in which she promoted her Be Best initiatives, which tackles online bullying.

Gen. Rod Rosenstein is flying Monday with President Trump on Air Force One to a police chiefs' conference in Florida.The flight provides an opportunity for their most extensive conversation since news reports last month that Rosenstein had discussed possibly secretly recording Trump to expose chaos in the White House and invoking constitutional provisions to get him removed from office.The reports, which Rosenstein denied, fueled speculation that Rosenstein might be fired or resign. Rosenstein told officials that he would be willing to resign and met at the White House with Chief of Staff John Kelly during a chaotic day two weeks ago that ended with him still in his Justice Department job.Rosenstein and Trump had been expected to meet at the White House days later, but that meeting was put off so that the president could focus on a confirmation hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. It was not immediately clear if the flight would substitute for the pre-planned White House meeting.Trump has said publicly that he would prefer not to fire the Justice Department's No. 2 official and that Rosenstein has told him he did not say the remarks attributed to him. Advisors had also cautioned Trump against doing anything dramatic in the weeks before the midterm elections next month, suggesting that Rosenstein's job is safe at least for now.Trump is scheduled to speak Monday at the International Assn. of Chiefs of Police conference in Orlando.Any termination or resignation of Rosenstein has the potential to affect the special counsel's investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign since Rosenstein appointed former FBI director Robert S. Mueller III to the job of special counsel and closely oversees his work.Although Trump has at times criticized his deputy attorney general, he has reserved his sharpest verbal attacks at Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions, who recused from the Russia investigation in March 2017 because of his involvement with the Trump campaign.Besides the meeting with Trump, Rosenstein has also agreed to a private meeting with House Republicans who want to question him about his reported statements on the president.","dateModified":"2018-10-08T14:43:15.700Z","datePublished":"2018-10-08T14:33:58.868Z","headline":"After meeting delay, Rosenstein to fly with Trump to Florida conference","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/987f4c2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+193/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F50%2F58%2Fe9aee71ca4f7d54e195654389ba5%2Fla-lb-media-ap18267578247110-20181008-063801","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#after-meeting-delay-rosenstein-to-fly-with-trump-to-florida-conference"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageA southern Minnesota television reporter who wore a \"Make America Great Again\" hat to a Trump rally that he was covering has been fired.James Bunner was a multimedia journalist for KTTC-TV in Austin.

Jeff Flake announced his support for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, he was confronted with some of the consequences.Two women cornered him as he got on an elevator Friday, pleading for him to reconsider his support for Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault. The raw, emotional moment was caught on television, capturing the charged atmosphere in the Capitol as senators prepare to vote.\"Look at me and tell me that it doesn't matter what happened to me,\" said 23-year-old Maria Gallagher.A day earlier, the senators heard hours of testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, a California psychology professor who told them Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when the two were teenagers. Kavanaugh strongly denied the allegation in hours of bombastic testimony.Flake had lobbied Republican leaders to give Ford the chance to speak. He was viewed as a possible no vote, until the announcement Friday morning.The senator was on his way to the Senate Judiciary Committee meeting room as the two women, who are both affiliated with advocacy groups, told him they were sexual assault survivors.\"On Monday, I stood in front of your office,\" Ana Maria Archila, co-executive director of the nonprofit Center for Popular Democracy Action, told Flake. \"I told the story of my sexual assault. I told it because I recognized in Dr. Ford's story that she is telling the truth. What you are doing is allowing someone who actually violated a woman to sit on the Supreme Court.\"Archila, 39, appeared to block the elevator door from closing with the senator inside.Then Gallagher said: \"I was sexually assaulted and nobody believed me. I didn't tell anyone, and you're telling all women that they don't matter, that they should just stay quiet because if they tell you what happened to them you are going to ignore them.\"\"That's what happened to me, and that's what you are telling all women in America, that they don't matter,\" she said through tears.She begged Flake to look her in the eye. She said: \"Don't look away from me.\"Flake, cornered in the elevator, shifted between looking at them and looking down. He said, \"Thank you,\" but didn't respond to questions on whether he believed Ford's testimony.When a reporter asked whether he wanted to respond to the women's questions, he said no.\"I need to go to the hearing.

Kavanaugh denied he was \"at any such party.\" He said he did not question that perhaps Ford at some point in her life was sexually assaulted, \"but what I know is I've never sexually assaulted anyone.\"Kavanaugh said it was possible he may have met Ford at some time, but he said they were not friends and did not travel in the same social circles. He said he did not remember being at a party with her.\"I was not at the party described,\" Kavanaugh said.Kavanaugh was asked whether there was any chance Ford misunderstood an exchange between them.\"I have never had any sexual or physical activity with Dr. Ford,\" Kavanaugh said. \"I've never sexually assaulted anyone, in high school or otherwise.\"The second woman, Deborah Ramirez, has accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her at a Yale University dormitory party, putting his penis in her face and causing her to touch it without her consent as she pushed him away.Kavanaugh said Monday, \"I never did any such thing.\"\"If such a thing had happened, it would have been the talk of campus,\" Kavanaugh said.It's rare for nominees to the Supreme Court to give interviews.

Kavanaugh was defiant as well.\"I'm not going to let false accusations drive us out of this process,\" Kavanaugh said.Democrats have accused Republicans of not conducting a thorough review in their rush to get Kavanaugh confirmed. They want the FBI to reopen its background investigation of Kavanaugh and look into the allegations against him.Ford and Kavanaugh are set to testify Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.In the Fox interview, Kavanaugh got a taste of the personal questions he'll face from senators. MacCallum asked him how long he was a virgin in college, after he volunteered that he never had sex in high school.\"Many years after. I'll leave it at that,\" Kavanaugh said.Ashley Kavanaugh was asked whether she wondered if her husband was telling the truth about the allegations against him. \"No, I know Brett.

Gen. Rod Rosenstein denied a New York Times report Friday that he suggested that he secretly record President Trump last year to expose chaos in the administration and that he floated the idea of using the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.The Times cited several people, who were not named, who described episodes that came in the spring of 2017 after FBI Director James Comey was fired. The newspaper said its sources also included people who were briefed on memos written by FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.Rosenstein took issue with the story.\"The New York Times' story is inaccurate and factually incorrect,\" Rosenstein said in a statement. \"I will not further comment on a story based on anonymous sources who are obviously biased against the department and are advancing their own personal agenda. But let me be clear about this: Based on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.\"The 25th Amendment to the Constitution spells out that a president can be declared \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\" upon a majority vote of the vice president and the Cabinet.A person who was in the room at the time, and provided a statement through the Justice Department, said Rosenstein's comment was \"sarcastic\" and that he \"never discussed any intention of recording a conversation with the president.\"The newspaper reported that Rosenstein, frustrated with the hiring process for a new FBI director after Comey's firing, offered to wear a \"wire\" and secretly record the president when he visited the White House. He also suggested that McCabe could also perhaps record Trump, the newspaper said.McCabe's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, said in a statement that his client had drafted memos to \"memorialize significant discussions he had with high level officials and preserved them so he would have an accurate, contemporaneous record of those discussions.\"McCabe's memos, which were later turned over to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's office, had remained at the FBI until McCabe was ousted in January and McCabe doesn't know how any reporters might have obtained them, Bromwich said.Update, 12:15 p.m.: This article was updated with Rosenstein’s response and other details.This article was originally published at 11:49 a.m.","dateModified":"2018-09-21T19:29:22.400Z","datePublished":"2018-09-21T19:15:00.000Z","headline":"Rod Rosenstein denies that he proposed secretly taping Trump or invoking 25th Amendment","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/06ec7ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+106/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd7%2F8f%2F3bf545ea42e85827ff151105af0f%2Fla-lb-media-afp-getty-us-politics-supremecourt13-20180921-115345","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#rod-rosenstein-denies-that-he-proposed-secretly-taping-trump-or-invoking-25th-amendment"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway says the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct should not be conflated with the assault allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his denial.Conway told CNN on Friday, \"Let's not conflate the larger #MeToo movement with whatever did nor did not happen in the summer of 1982.\"Conway was a GOP political consultant for decades before working for President Trump.

A Dem!\"The president's attack came after Trumka appeared on \"Fox News Sunday\" over the weekend, saying efforts to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement should include Canada. Trumka, whose organization is an umbrella group for most unions, said the economies of the United States, Canada and Mexico are \"integrated\" and \"it's pretty hard to see how that would work without having Canada in the deal.\"Trump said Saturday on Twitter that there was \"no political necessity\" to keep Canada in NAFTA. But it's questionable whether Trump can unilaterally exclude Canada from a deal to replace the three-nation NAFTA agreement, without the approval of Congress. Any such move would likely face lengthy legal and congressional challenges.Trump administration negotiations to keep Canada in the reimagined trade bloc are to resume this week as Washington and Ottawa try to break a deadlock over issues such as Canada's dairy market and U.S. efforts to shield drug companies from generic competition.Trump wants to get a trade deal finalized by Dec. 1.Trumka also said of Trump: \"The things that he's done to hurt workers outpace what he's done to help workers,\" arguing that Trump has not come through with an infrastructure program and has overturned regulations that \"will hurt us on the job.\"Asked about the low unemployment rate and economic growth, Trumka said \"those are good, but wages have been down since the first of the year.

I have tried to serve our country honorably. I have made mistakes, but I hope my love for America will be weighed favorably against them.  “I have often observed that I am the luckiest person on Earth. I feel that way even now as I prepare for the end of my life. I have loved my life, all of it. I have had experiences, adventures and friendships enough for 10 satisfying lives, and I am so thankful. Like most people, I have regrets. But I would not trade a day of my life, in good or bad times, for the best day of anyone else’s.   “I owe that satisfaction to the love of my family. No man ever had a more loving wife or children he was prouder of than I am of mine. And I owe it to America. To be connected to America’s causes — liberty, equal justice, respect for the dignity of all people — brings happiness more sublime than life’s fleeting pleasures. Our identities and sense of worth are not circumscribed, but enlarged, by serving good causes bigger than ourselves.  “‘Fellow Americans’ — that association has meant more to me than any other. I lived and died a proud American. We are citizens of the world’s greatest republic, a nation of ideals, not blood and soil. We are blessed and are a blessing to humanity when we uphold and advance those ideals at home and in the world. We have helped liberate more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history. We have acquired great wealth and power in the process.  “We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe. We weaken it when we hide behind walls, rather than tear them down, when we doubt the power of our ideals, rather than trust them to be the great force for change they have always been.  “We are 325 million opinionated, vociferous individuals. We argue and compete and sometimes even vilify each other in our raucous public debates. But we have always had so much more in common with each other than in disagreement. If only we remember that and give each other the benefit of the presumption that we all love our country, we will get through these challenging times. We will come through them stronger than before. We always do.  “Ten years ago, I had the privilege to concede defeat in the election for president. I want to end my farewell to you with the heartfelt faith in Americans that I felt so powerfully that evening. I feel it powerfully still.  “Do not despair of our present difficulties, but believe always in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history.  “Farewell, fellow Americans. God bless you, and God bless America.”","dateModified":"2018-08-27T22:31:33.591Z","datePublished":"2018-08-27T18:52:00.000Z","headline":"In a farewell statement, Sen.

John McCain brought an outpouring of tributes from Washington. Even the senator’s most bitter political rivals weighed in with gratitude for his service, straight talk and decency.President Trump, who rarely missed an opportunity to try to tear down the Arizona Republican when he was alive – mocking McCain even for his time as a prisoner of war – offered a respectful note of condolence, as did the first lady.  The Trump Twitter messages followed a report in the Washington Post that President Trump had purposefully avoided sending any public well wishes to McCain in his final days, as the bitterness between the two men endured. TweetBefore the Trumps posted their message, President Obama – who ran against McCain in the 2008 election – had posted his tribute. TweetOthers posted their own personal remembrances, detailing how the senator inspired and motivated them.  Among those was McCain’s campaign manager Steve Schmidt, who in June quit a Republican Party he called “corrupt” and “immoral” under Trump. TweetMcCain’s death came at a time one of his closest allies in the Senate, South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, has aligned with Trump in ways it is hard to imagine McCain ever would, with Graham bolstering the president’s attacks on the special counsel investigation. But the bond of the two men remained strong until the end.“I’ve lost one of my dearest friends and mentor,” Graham wrote on Twitter. TweetDemocrats offered their own fond memories of a man they tangled with often, but also formed an enduring bond with.“As you go through life, you meet few truly great people,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer wrote on Twitter. “John McCain was one of them. His dedication to his country and the military were unsurpassed, and maybe most of all, he was a truth teller - never afraid to speak truth to power in an era where that has become all too rare.”Some Democrats could not resist contrasting their respect for McCain with their distaste for Trump.

Sessions says he's “proud of the work we have done in successfully advancing the rule of law.” Read the full statement: Tweet","dateModified":"2018-08-23T18:01:46.556Z","datePublished":"2018-08-23T17:39:00.000Z","headline":"Atty.

Mueller III. This was no “witch hunt.”After being presented with voluminous evidence and testimony about the tens of millions of dollars Manafort made working for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine and his efforts to conceal his income from the U.S. government, the jury convicted the veteran political consultant of five counts of filing false tax returns, two counts of bank fraud and one count of failure to disclose a foreign bank account.That the jury failed to reach a verdict on 10 other counts, causing the judge to declare a mistrial on those charges, is undeniably a disappointment for the prosecution. But it doesn’t alter the seriousness of the crimes of which Manafort was found guilty.

It is President Trump’s second major move in less than a month reflecting a retreat in the fight against global warming, following the administration’s plan to freeze fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks.The new power plan will relieve the electricity industry — the second-largest producer of potent greenhouse gases nationwide — from aggressive goals for reducing its carbon footprint. Heavily polluting coal plants that would have been forced into retirement under the Obama-era guidelines get a new lease on life under the Trump blueprint, which allows them to continue operating with modest modification.In some cases, states may be permitted to ignore federal guidelines for certain plants altogether and pursue their own strategy. Trump is expected to tout the plan at an event Tuesday in the coal stronghold of West Virginia.The Natural Resources Defense Council called the replacement proposal Trump's \"Dirty Power Plan.\"Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey cited this summer's wildfires and increasing droughts and coastal flooding as evidence that man-made climate change from burning coal and other fossil fuels is already well upon the United States. \"Once again, this administration is choosing polluters' profits over public health and safety,\" he said.Scientists say that without extensive study they cannot directly link a single weather event to climate change but that it is responsible for increased intensity and frequency of extreme events such as storms, droughts, floods and wildfires.In a statement, Republican Sen. John Barrasso from the coal state of Wyoming welcomed the overhaul of the 2015 regulations.Climate-conscious states like California already are mobilizing to fight, arguing the administration’s approach violates the Clean Air Act. The Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that the law requires the federal government to take steps to combat air pollutants that are warming the global climate.Read More","dateModified":"2018-08-21T15:23:04.699Z","datePublished":"2018-08-21T14:48:00.000Z","headline":"Trump administration rewrites coal emissions rules in a boon for heavily polluting facilities","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/86096ef/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F91%2F56%2F972552dd0cf8ac9ae1d917ad9697%2Fla-lb-media-ap18233475277870-20180821-074537","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"staff and wire"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#trump-administration-rewrites-coal-emissions-rules-in-a-boon-for-heavily-polluting-facilities"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImagePresident Trump invited a U.S. Border Patrol agent to the podium during a White House event to pay tribute to federal immigration officials and joked that the agent could speak \"perfect English.\"Trump asked the agent, Adrian Anzaldua, to discuss his apprehension of a smuggler accused of locking 78 migrants inside a truck near Laredo, Texas, about a week ago.Trump also appeared to refer to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, as CBC during Monday's event.

Mueller III’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and his decision to pull Brennan’s security clearance and review the clearances of other Obama-era officials, according to an interview the president gave to the Wall Street Journal.On Tuesday, Brennan retweeted a Trump tweet attacking his former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman and added his own commentary: “It’s astounding how often you fail to live up to minimum standards of decency, civility, & probity. Seems like you will never understand what it means to be president, nor what it takes to be a good, decent, & honest person. So disheartening, so dangerous for our Nation.”He also criticized Trump on MSNBC later Tuesday, calling him “dangerous to our nation.”In the op-ed, Brennan wrote, “The only questions that remain are whether the collusion that took place constituted criminally liable conspiracy, whether obstruction of justice occurred to cover up any collusion or conspiracy, and how many members of ‘Trump Incorporated’ attempted to defraud the government by laundering and concealing the movement of money into their pockets.”Trump released a statement Wednesday outlining why he took the step, which was dated July 26 and cited “a series of unfounded and outrageous allegations — wild outbursts on the internet and television — about this Administration.”“Mr. Brennan’s lying and recent conduct, characterized by increasingly frenzied commentary, is wholly inconsistent with access to the Nation’s most closely held secrets and facilitates the very aim of our adversaries, which is to sow division and chaos,” Trump said in the statement.Terrence Dopp writes for Bloomberg News.","dateModified":"2018-08-16T17:40:44.472Z","datePublished":"2018-08-16T17:32:00.000Z","headline":"Brennan scorns Trump for ‘hogwash’ in denying Russian collusion","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ab25f48/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+125/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F72%2Fe2%2F2f7457f6364f7f418051bb805a15%2Fla-lb-media-afp-getty-files-us-politics-security-20180816-102710","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Terrence Dopp"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#brennan-scorns-trump-for-hogwash-in-denying-russian-collusion"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImagePresident Trump and administration officials frequently overstate the strength of the labor market and their role in it, but now, a top White House official has admitted she went too far with the latest claim about black employment.White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has issued a rare public apology for saying at Tuesday’s press briefing that Trump already had created three times more jobs for blacks than former President Obama did during his entire eight-year term.It’s not true.

Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Claire McCaskill of Missouri both said their congressional offices were targeted by Russian hackers. Last week, Democratic Sen.

His remarks came after a tour through the early-voting state that included a visit to the state fair and meetings with key Democratic officials.\"What I fear for this Democratic Party that I love is that we have a tendency to bring nail clippers to gunfights,\" Avenatti told an enthusiastic crowd in the Surf Ballroom and Museum. \"Tonight I want to suggest a different course. I believe that the Democratic Party must be a party that fights fire with fire.\"He added, \"When they go low, I say we hit harder.\"It was a reversal of former First Lady Michelle Obama's declaration at the 2016 Democratic Convention, \"When they go low, we go high.\"In an interview, Avenatti said: \"At that point in time, for what she was speaking about, I think that was the right message. But as we sit here now, that approach clearly will not work.\"Known for his combative cable news appearances, Avenatti offered a relatively traditional political address that stressed his record as a self-made businessman, an advocate for underdogs and a formidable foe to President Trump. He stressed his support for \"Medicare for all\" and \"sensible gun control.\" And he dubbed Trump a \"con man\" and his presidency a \"Dumpster fire.\"Organizers of the Wing Ding — which has drawn heavy hitters like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in past years — said he boosted ticket sales.Avenatti said his visit to the State Fair included a stop at the butter cow — a cow sculpted in butter — two pork chops on a stick and plenty of conversation with people who recognized him and encouraged him to keep going. He strolled the fairgrounds drinking beer from a plastic cup and traded the gray suit for a blue gingham long-sleeved shirt and jeans, the typical dress code of a visiting politician.\"I've learned that the people of Iowa are fairly receptive to me and receptive to my message,\" said Avenatti, who plans to visit early-voting New Hampshire in the next few weeks and will return to Iowa.","dateModified":"2018-08-11T06:03:08.303Z","datePublished":"2018-08-11T03:38:00.000Z","headline":"In Iowa, Stormy Daniels’ lawyer, Michael Avenatti, says Democrats must fight","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/583f75f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2Fa8%2F2334482cd3c66c774c0184c39a50%2Fla-michael-avenatt-20180810","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#in-iowa-stormy-daniels-lawyer-michael-avenatti-says-democrats-must-fight"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe Senate is scheduled to begin the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Sept. 4.Sen.

No Republicans were on the ballot, making Bell all but certain to win in November. Bell, 43, is an attorney and former municipal judge and prosecutor. He was elected councilman in 2015 as protests continued to rage over Brown's death.At a raucous election night party, Bell recalled that even close friends told him he had no chance. He called for unity. “There's too much divisiveness, too much division in this county, in this region,” Bell said in a video posted on his campaign Facebook page. “We've got to start bringing people together.” McCulloch couldn't be reached for comment. MORE COVERAGE FROM TUESDAY NIGHT'S MIDTERM ELECTIONSThe prosecutor's race put Ferguson back in the spotlight four years after Brown's death led to months of often-violent protests, prompted significant reforms in the St. Louis suburb and helped fuel the national Black Lives Matter movement. Many onlookers saw the election as a referendum on what happened in Ferguson. It marked the first time McCulloch had been challenged since Brown's death. Brown, a black and unarmed 18-year-old, died Aug. 9, 2014, in a street confrontation with white Officer Darren Wilson. Some witnesses said Brown had his hands up in surrender. Wilson said Brown was moving aggressively toward him and he fired the fatal shots in self-defense.A St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict Wilson, who later resigned. Critics accused McCulloch, who is white, of skewing the investigation in favor of the officer.The U.S. Department of Justice launched its own investigation. While the Justice Department found no grounds to indict Wilson, a scathing report found racial bias in the way Ferguson police and courts treated black people. A consent agreement requires the city to take several steps to remove that bias, including hiring more minority police officers and court reforms. Bell campaigned on a platform to “fundamentally change the culture” of the prosecutor's office, partially by assigning special prosecutors to review allegations of police misconduct. Black residents make up about 23% of St. Louis County's population. Bell and McCulloch are both sons of police officers. But McCulloch, an ardent police supporter, became a target of critics who unsuccessfully demanded he recuse himself from the Brown case, citing his family history. Several of his relatives worked for the St. Louis Police Department, including his father, who was fatally shot by a black suspect when McCulloch was 12. ","dateModified":"2018-08-08T18:38:44.565Z","datePublished":"2018-08-08T15:54:00.000Z","headline":"The prosecutor who handled the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown lost a primary challenge to a Ferguson councilman","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5914ea9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+108/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F79%2Fbbdd245371f8e500f19de92b257e%2Fla-lb-media-ap18219735259885-20180808-085049","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#the-prosecutor-who-handled-the-fatal-police-shooting-of-michael-brown-lost-a-primary-challenge-to-a-ferguson-councilman"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe steady march of new so-called right-to-work laws in Republican-led states hit a wall in Missouri, where voters resoundingly rejected a measure that could have weakened union finances after national and local labor groups poured millions of dollars into the campaign against it. Missouri's law against compulsory union fees was defeated Tuesday by a 2-to-1 margin, nearly a year after the measure adopted by the state's Republican governor and Legislature had been scheduled to take effect. It was put hold after unions successfully petitioned to force a public referendum. The election results effectively vetoed the Missouri measure and halted a string of stinging losses for organized labor. Since 2012, five other once historically strong union states had adopted laws limiting mandatory union fees as Republicans gained strength in state capitols, raising the total to 27 states with such laws. The Missouri referendum marked the first chance for voters to weigh in on union powers since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in late June that public sector employees cannot be compelled to pay fees to unions. Missouri's ballot measure essentially would have extended that to all private sector employees in the state. “Working people made their voices heard at the ballot box today and overturned right to work. It's a truly historic moment,” Missouri AFL-CIO President Mike Louis said. Missouri voters had last rejected such a law in 1978, when national union membership was more than double its current rate of 10.7%. Business groups and conservative interest groups pledged to try again to enact it in Missouri, potentially as soon as the 2019 legislative session. “The defeat of Proposition A is merely a minor setback on the road to providing workers with the freedom they deserve,” said Jeremy Cady, the Missouri director of Americans for Prosperity, which is part of the conservative Koch network. At issue are so-called fair-share fees, which are less than full dues but are intended to cover unions' nonpolitical costs such as collective bargaining. Unions say it's fair for workers to pay the fees, because federal law requires them to represent even those employees who don't join. But supporters of laws against compulsory fees counter that people should have the right to accept a job without being required to pay a union. Former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens signed such a bill in February 2017. It was supposed to take effect as law on Aug. 28. But before that could happen, union organizers submitted enough petition signatures to suspend its implementation pending a statewide referendum. Supporters of the law had been banking on Greitens to help draw money and attention to their campaign. But Greitens resigned amid scandal on June 1 and disappeared from the public spotlight. Unions powered an opposition effort that had spent more than $15 million as of late July, well over three times as much as various groups that support laws against the mandatory union fees. Advertisements generally focused on economics, with supporters claiming the law would lead to more jobs and opponents claiming it would drive down wages. Studies looking at the economic effects of such laws have found mixed and sometimes conflicting results. The Washington-based Economic Policy Institute, which opposes such laws, found that wages in “right-to-work”  states average 3.1% less than elsewhere after accounting for other workforce differences such as educational backgrounds, racial composition, the industrial makeup of employers and the cost of living. But a case study focused on Oklahoma found different results. Economists Ozkan Eren of Louisiana State University and Serkan Ozbeklik of Claremont McKenna College used data from states with similar characteristics to analyze the effect of Oklahoma's 2001 union fees law. They found it resulted in a significant reduction in private sector unionization rates but had no short-term effect on either the total unemployment rate or average private sector wages. Most laws against mandatory union fees laws were enacted in the 1940s and 1950s. But Republicans have led a resurgence of such laws, starting in Indiana in 2012 and following in Michigan, Wisconsin, West Virginia and Kentucky.  ","dateModified":"2018-08-08T16:16:29.620Z","datePublished":"2018-08-08T15:47:00.000Z","headline":"Missouri voters reject Republican ‘right-to-work’ law limiting labor union powers","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b4738d2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+155/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F19%2F24%2F5e041934b479ef2b65f564f57c14%2Fla-lb-media-apphoto-missouriprimaryrighttowork-20180808-084215","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#missouri-voters-reject-republican-right-to-work-law-limiting-labor-union-powers"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe Trump administration on Tuesday urged Canada and Saudi Arabia to settle an escalating diplomatic fight but avoided voicing support for the women’s rights activists whose jailing is at the heart of the dispute.“Both sides need to resolve this diplomatically together; we can’t do it for them,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.Nauert said the Trump administration stands for human liberties and due process but she refused to side with Canada or condemn Saudi Arabia’s arrest of the activists.Read More","dateModified":"2018-08-08T13:18:58.569Z","datePublished":"2018-08-08T13:28:34.368Z","headline":"As Saudi Arabia and Canada clash over women’s rights activists, U.S. treading lightly","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/74b2e5c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1022x575+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2F9d%2F7915aaa188dc767db1d3c448945a%2Fla-fg-us-canada-saudi-20180807","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Tracy Wilkinson"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#as-saudi-arabia-and-canada-clash-over-womens-rights-activists-u-s-treading-lightly"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe government's star witness in the financial fraud trial of Paul Manafort testified Monday that he embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from the former Trump campaign chairman and told jurors he and Manafort committed crimes together.Richard Gates has been regarded as a crucial witness for the government ever since he pleaded guilty this year to two felony charges and agreed to cooperate in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.In the beginning of a hugely anticipated courtroom showdown, Gates told jurors that he siphoned off the money without Manafort's knowledge by filing false expense reports. He also admitted to concealing millions of dollars in foreign bank accounts on Manafort's behalf and to falsifying loan applications and other documents to help Manafort obtain more in bank loans.Manafort's defense has sought to blame Gates, described by witnesses as his \"right-hand man,\" for any illegal conduct and accused him of embezzling millions of dollars from Manafort.Gates, who also served in a senior role in Donald Trump's presidential campaign, is expected to face aggressive cross-examination once prosecutors have finished questioning him. Gates pleaded guilty to financial fraud and to lying to investigators as he negotiated a plea agreement, something defense lawyers will no doubt seize on to try to undercut his credibility.He is awaiting sentencing and his ability to secure leniency from the government depends on him being cooperative and forthcoming with the jury.The criminal case has nothing to do with either man's work for the Trump campaign, and there has been no discussion during the trial about whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia — the central question Mueller's team has tried to answer. But Trump has shown interest in the proceedings, tweeting support for Manafort and suggesting that he had been treated worse than gangster Al Capone.The trial opened last week with a display of Manafort's opulent lifestyle, then progressed into testimony about what prosecutors say were years of financial deception. In calling Gates, the government will present jurors with the firsthand account of a co-conspirator expected to say Manafort was knee-deep in an alleged scheme to hide millions of dollars from the Internal Revenue Service and defraud several banks.During the questioning, U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III will be both a referee and a wild card. He has played those roles throughout the trial, repeatedly scolding prosecutors to rein in their depictions of Manafort's lavish lifestyle and demanding that they \"move it along.\" It is not a crime, he has said several times, to be rich and to spend ostentatiously.Day and Barakat write for the Associated Press.","dateModified":"2018-08-06T23:30:26.558Z","datePublished":"2018-08-06T22:39:00.000Z","headline":"Paul Manafort’s business partner Richard Gates testifies that the two committed crimes together","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d3effa8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+160/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F47%2Ffa%2Fbebc56735126d1c9145ad4482b96%2Fla-lb-media-apphoto-trumpmanafortprobemanafort-20180806-153835","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Chad Day"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Matt Barakat"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#paul-manaforts-business-partner-richard-gates-testifies-that-the-two-committed-crimes-together"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageKris Kobach didn’t mention the persistent budget woes plaguing Kansas.

Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Daniels, was among the scores of critics who took to Twitter to point that out — and, in his case, put in a plug for a possible 2020 presidential bid to challenge Trump. TweetDaniels is seeking to void an agreement with Trump under which she received $130,000 to stay silent about an alleged affair.For many, Trump's claim brought to mind reports of President George H.W. Bush expressing amazement upon seeing a supermarket scanner during his 1992 reelection campaign. John Dean, the former White House counsel under President Nixon, was among those to draw a comparison between the two episodes.\"George H.W. Bush lost an election for not having any idea how a electronic scanner in a market worked,\" Dean wrote on Twitter. \"Trump thinks you need photo ID to buy groceries. May his ignorance come back to defeat him, not to mention his ignorance is 10,000 times Bush's!\"Kaili Joy Gray, the managing editor of the liberal website Shareblue, also sought to portray Trump as out of touch.\"This man has never bought a carton of milk in his life, has he?\" she asked on Twitter.Media covering Trump's rally were among the first to pounce on Tuesday night as the president rallied the faithful and promoted the Florida gubernatorial candidacy of Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla.\"Honest question: What's the last time he's bought groceries?\" wrote Zeke Miller, a White House reporter for the Associated Press.Jim Acosta of CNN, a frequent target of criticism by Trump, also weighed in with a tweet, writing: \"Trump out of touch here . . . you don't need an ID to buy groceries.”","dateModified":"2018-08-01T17:13:47.155Z","datePublished":"2018-08-01T14:33:00.000Z","headline":"Critics pounce on Trump’s assertion that you need ID to buy groceries","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/39b9cf5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+110/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F77%2Fea%2F387ed6b453b5af6a770120907081%2Fla-lb-media-afp-getty-topshot-us-politics-trump-rally-20180801-072810","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"John Wagner, Washington Post"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#critics-pounce-on-trumps-assertion-that-you-need-id-to-buy-groceries"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageA Los Angeles federal judge on Tuesday denied Michael Cohen’s request to impose a gag order on Michael Avenatti, saying it would violate the attorney’s right to free speech.U.S. District Judge S.

Sulzberger occurred July 20, the White House and Times said. “Had a very good and interesting meeting at the White House with A.G. Sulzberger, Publisher of the New York Times,” Trump tweeted Sunday. “Spent much time talking about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media & how that Fake News has morphed into phrase, “Enemy of the People.” Sad!” Sulzberger said in a statement issued after Trump's tweet that he told the president his incendiary language about the media was “not just divisive but increasingly dangerous.” He said the president's rhetoric was being used by authoritarian regimes to justify attacks on journalists. “I warned that it was putting lives at risk, that it was undermining the democratic ideals of our nation, and that it was eroding one of our country's greatest exports: a commitment to free speech and a free press,” Sulzberger said. Trump often describes the Times, a publication he regularly reads and has given interviews to, as the “failing New York Times.” In May, the New York Times Co. reported first-quarter revenue of about $414 million, a 3.8% increase from the first quarter of 2017. The president, who bristles at negative media coverage, has labeled the news media the “enemy of the people” and regularly accuses it of spreading “fake news,” which is the term he often uses for stories he does not consider complimentary. Sulzberger said he accepted the White House's request for a meeting so he could discuss Trump's “deeply troubling anti-press rhetoric.” He said Times publishers have long held meetings with presidential administrations and other public figures who have concerns with coverage of them. After Sulzberger took over from his father on Jan. 1, Trump tweeted that his ascension gives the paper a “last chance” to fulfill its founder's vision of impartiality. In that tweet, Trump urged the new publisher, “Get impartial journalists of a much higher standard, lose all of your phony and non-existent ‘sources,’ and treat the President of the United States FAIRLY, so that the next time I (and the people) win, you won't have to write an apology to your readers for a job poorly done!” Sulzberger said Sunday that he made clear to Trump that he was not asking the president to stop speaking out about coverage he felt was unfair. “Instead,” Sulzberger said, “I implored him to reconsider his broader attacks on journalism, which I believe are dangerous and harmful to our country.” Read

His new version was undercut by his fuller and widely watched remarks on Monday. Also, Trump no longer was speaking alongside Russia's President Vladimir Putin, but addressing reporters from the White House alongside Republican lawmakers.In his attempt to walk back his Helsinki remarks, Trump said he accepts the consensus of American intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election. Yet in a sign that he cannot fully accept those findings — seeing them as a challenge to his legitimacy — he added that it \"could be other people also.\" That assertion is not supported by known intelligence.In Helsinki, as Putin looked on, Trump said the following to a question about whether he believed U.S. intelligence agencies, or Putin's denials of interference: \"My people came to me...they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin, he just said it's not Russia.

Because they would not, “Lisa is not going to appear for an interview at this time,” Amy Jeffress said in a statement Tuesday evening. The committees are interested in Page as part of their investigation into what they say is bias at the Justice Department. Page exchanged text messages critical of Donald Trump with FBI agent Peter Strzok, who will testify publicly before the panel Thursday. Page and Strzok both worked on the FBI investigation into Democrat Hillary Clinton's emails and, later, special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. House Judiciary Chairman Robert Goodlatte said Page has known for months that the panel has sought her testimony, and the committee will use “all tools at our disposal” to obtain it. If a witness does not respond to a subpoena, the full House can vote to hold her in contempt of Congress. “It appears that Lisa Page has something to hide,” Goodlatte said. House Republicans have suggested the FBI was conspiring against Trump during and after his presidential campaign, and the two committees are investigating decisions made by the agency and the Justice Department during the 2016 presidential election. The Judiciary committee issued a subpoena Saturday for Page to appear Wednesday, according to Jeffress. She suggested on Monday that it was still unclear whether Page would appear, saying in a statement that they were “still waiting to work out a reasonable date” for the interview and waiting on documents from the FBI to prepare. On Tuesday, Jeffress said she and Page had gone to the FBI to review the materials, “but after waiting for more than three hours, we were not provided with any documents.” The Judiciary and Oversight panels have already spent much of the summer holding hearings and interviews critical of the FBI and Justice Department. Democrats have strongly objected to the GOP-led investigation, saying it is an attempt to undermine Mueller's probe and sway public opinion against investigators. The committees have focused much of their ire on Strzok, who was interviewed privately by lawmakers on the two committees for 11 hours June 27. He will return to Capitol Hill for the hearing Thursday, the first time he will speak publicly about the messages. Strzok had a leading role in the Clinton probe and was removed from the Mueller investigation after the texts were discovered a year ago. Page had already left the Mueller team. A report by the Justice Department's internal watchdog released last month detailed the inflammatory texts between the two, including an exchange in which Strzok wrote “we'll stop it” in reference to a potential Trump election. The report did not find that the conclusions in the Clinton investigation were tainted by political bias. The Judiciary Committee also held a contentious hearing June 28 with FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Atty. Gen. Rod Rosenstein. In the hearing, Republicans angrily accused the officials of withholding documents from them and demanded details about surveillance tactics in the Russia investigation. ","dateModified":"2018-07-11T15:51:10.533Z","datePublished":"2018-07-11T15:41:00.000Z","headline":"Attorney: Ex-FBI lawyer Lisa Page won’t show for House interview","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#attorney-ex-fbi-lawyer-lisa-page-wont-show-for-house-interview"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImagePresident Trump kicked off his two-day visit with NATO allies by doing exactly what many of them feared, worsening tensions within the alliance by claiming that Germany, a bulwark of the transatlantic democratic order, \"is totally controlled by\" and \"captive to Russia.\"Trump, who often goes on the attack by accusing someone of behavior he has been accused of, irked allies last month by suggesting that Russia should be readmitted to the G-7, and is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday.

He also said the agency has been working with Mexican counterparts to hold families seeking asylum at shelters in Mexico instead of letting them wait on border bridges where they would be “exposed to the elements.”The numbers are the first the agency has released concerning family separations at legal ports amid the Trump administration’s enforcement of its “zero-tolerance” policy.By contrast, more than 2,000 children were taken from parents who crossed the border illegally since the administration began enforcing its new policy in early May. Under the zero-tolerance policy, officials said they would charge all adults who crossed the border illegally with misdemeanors. Because children can’t be placed in adult jails, the criminal charges became grounds for splitting up the families.The agents’ statements about the rarity of separations of families entering at legal ports of entry conflict with news reports and findings by a federal judge who has ordered the federal government to reunite all children younger than 5 with their families by Tuesday.In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw of San Diego wrote that there had been a “casual, if not deliberate, separation of families that lawfully present at the port of entry, not just those who cross into the country illegally.”The Times reported this month on a number of cases since last year in which families were separated after asking for asylum at a port of entry. The separations happened even when asylum seekers carried records, such as birth certificates or hospital documents, listing them as the parents of their children, according to interviews and court records. At the time, border officials told The Times the agency did not have data showing how often such separations occur.Some of the cases reviewed by The Times happened in the days after the families presented themselves at a port of entry, when they had been transferred to the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Those cases would not necessarily be counted in the statistics that Customs and Border Protection released Monday.Owen said family separation has rarely been the practice with asylum seekers at ports of entry. If asylum seekers have been turned away, he said, it has been because of a lack of resources. The challenges have been compounded by 1,300 vacancies across the agency and efforts to curb the flow of meth, heroin and opioids, he said.Despite the administration’s strict but changing immigration policies, families have continued to come across the border. The number of families crossing at ports of entry, primarily the southern border bridges, decreased from 35,476 in 2016 to 29,377 last year only to spike again this year, 37,397 as of June.Owen said roughly 532,000 people and 208,000 vehicles cross into the U.S daily. The two busiest ports are in Tijuana and San Ysidro.Customs officials have been stationed at the “limit lines” at entry points in recent months, preventing asylum seekers from entering the country, intermittently halting the processing of asylum seekers at border bridges at times in recent weeks.Owen said he could not provide an estimate as to how long it takes to process families. “We try to get them out as quickly as we can,” he said.Staff writer Molly Hennessy-Fiske contributed to this report.","dateModified":"2018-07-09T22:35:50.069Z","datePublished":"2018-07-09T16:02:00.000Z","headline":"Customs agency says only 7 families separated at ports of entry from May to June, conflicting with news reports and a judge’s ruling","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b8f7d72/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1399x787+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa8%2Fba%2Fdeb7b32e67590dfb15ff5b9ab0a9%2Fla-1530461705-nqttb8juld-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Jazmine Ulloa"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Paloma Esquivel"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#customs-agency-says-only-7-families-separated-at-ports-of-entry-from-may-to-june-conflicting-with-news-reports-and-a-judges-ruling"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageA 30% U.S. tariff on imported solar panels put in place last winter should have caused prices here to jump.But when tariffs are unleashed, as businesses are learning, things don’t always go as expected.Therein lies a cautionary tale of the uncertainty in store for other industries as the Trump administration’s latest tariffs took effect Friday against hundreds of Chinese imports valued at $34 billion, including semiconductors, farm machinery, medical devices and aircraft parts.Read More","dateModified":"2018-07-09T13:33:44.883Z","datePublished":"2018-07-09T13:28:46.000Z","headline":"The roiled solar power market shows how Trump’s tariffs can disrupt an industry","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e9e7ee9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2F5f%2Fb996163be968d8b0ee6aab72c1e6%2Fla-fi-solar-tariffs-20180707","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Don Lee"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Jim Puzzanghera"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#the-roiled-solar-power-market-shows-how-trumps-tariffs-can-disrupt-an-industry"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageSecretary of State Michael R.

The Supreme Court has upheld race-conscious admission practices as recently as 2016, but affirmative action in higher education remains a contentious issue.In 2011 and 2016, the Obama administration's Justice and Education departments jointly spelled out for colleges their view of the law on the voluntary use of race in admissions.The 2011 statement said the departments \"recognize the compelling interest that postsecondary institutions have in obtaining the benefits that flow from achieving a diverse student body.\" It went on to assert that schools have flexibility \"to take proactive steps, in a manner consistent with principles articulated in Supreme Court opinions, to meet this compelling interest.\"The Obama-era documents replaced a 2008 letter on the subject from the Bush administration. Now it appears that the Trump administration is about to assert its own views. A Justice Department spokesman said an announcement was imminent.Former Obama officials criticized the move.\"Once again, the Trump administration works to create confusion where none exists, needlessly muddying civil rights practices in schools,\" said Catherine E. Lhamon, assistant education secretary for civil rights under Obama. \"The Supreme Court has been consistent over decades in its rulings on lawful use of race in affirmative action, and the guidance the Trump administration rescinds today offered nothing more than a clear and practical statement of the law and how to comply with it.

Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, 81, has been the deciding vote on several major cases – including approval of same-sex marriage in 2015.Trump said Kennedy’s replacement would be selected from a list of 25 people that he updated last year. Leading candidates include federal appeals court Judges Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana, Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania and Brett Kavanaugh, who sits on the D.C. Circuit.Kavanaugh, a staunch conservative and a former law clerk for Kennedy, was a top deputy to Kenneth M. Starr, the Independent Counsel in the drive to impeach President Clinton. President George W. Bush later appointed Kavanaugh to the appeals court.In December, Kavanaugh was one of three dissenters in a case that allowed two pregnant teenage immigrants being held in detention facilities to obtain abortions. Opposite Kavanaugh was Merrick Garland, the judge President Obama nominated to fill the seat vacated by Justice Anthony Scalia’s death, but who ultimately was denied before Trump brought in Justice Neil Gorsuch.Before Kennedy announced his retirement, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand tweeted criticism about the Trump administration’s Supreme Court list, calling the choices a “danger to women’s health.” TweetBut in a Republican-controlled Senate, Democrats will have a difficult time preventing Trump’s nominee from being approved.As David Savage noted, if the high court shifts to a solidly conservative majority, the move could open the way to overturning Roe v. Wade and allowing states to once again make abortion illegal. Other issues on which the court could move include expanded protections for gun owners, limits on gay rights and broader ability for the government to detain and deport immigrants who enter the country illegally. Leaving Kennedy aside, the court has four justices in the conservative camp – Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Gorsuch – and four on the liberal side, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Ginsburg, the oldest on the court, has made it clear that she has no plans to retire.","dateModified":"2018-06-27T21:47:31.250Z","datePublished":"2018-06-27T21:15:00.000Z","headline":"Trump’s leading picks for Kennedy’s replacement would shift Supreme Court to conservative majority","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0967a24/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+137/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2Fc6%2F3f41a3737aaf8e76690caf0496d2%2Fla-lb-media-apphoto-supremecourtkennedyretires-20180627-123406","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Colleen Shalby"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#trumps-leading-picks-for-kennedys-replacement-would-shift-supreme-court-to-conservative-majority"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImagePresident Trump said he will soon pick a nominee to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy from the same list of people he announced during his election campaign, and from which he chose his first justice, Neil Gorsuch.“Hopefully we will pick someone who is just as outstanding” as Gorsuch, Trump told reporters ahead of a meeting with the president of Portugal.The list of 25 people — now 24 with Gorsuch’s selection — names decidedly conservative jurists and one Republican senator, Mike Lee of Utah.

TweetTrump has shown consistent inconsistency on the proposal. Last Friday, he said during a television interview that he opposed it. Hours later, the White House reversed course, saying he supported it.During a meeting with lawmakers earlier this week, Trump said he supported the bill \"1,000%.\"The shifts offered another reminder to Republican lawmakers of Trump’s unreliability as a political partner. The president, uniquely capable of providing lawmakers with the political cover to take difficult votes on immigration, has hesitated to commit to legislation and often reversed himself after doing so.The tweet comes at the end of a week in which the administration’s controversial “zero tolerance” policy toward immigrants crossing the border illegally, which has forced the separation of more than 2,300 migrant children from their parents, has prompted many of his GOP allies to split with the White House. Trump, as he indicated in his tweet, believes a divisive debate over immigration will benefit his party in November’s midterm elections, and he has continued to claim that Democrats are to blame for the immigration impasse. Many rank-and-file Republicans, however, already facing a strong Democratic headwind and nervous about preserving their majorities, aren't convinced.The legislation in question, backed by Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), offered a potential vehicle for a long-term fix to the law under which immigrant families have been separated under the administration’s zero tolerance policy that went into effect last month.As of Friday, the proposal was scheduled for a vote next week, although it already appeared to be unlikely to pass, largely because of divisions within the GOP. Some conservative Republicans have labeled the proposal an “amnesty” because it includes a potential path to citizenship for the so-called Dreamers — young immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children.Even prior to the president’s Friday morning tweet, the GOP leadership had struggled to whip up votes for the proposal. After the tweet, it seemed doomed.“Game over,” Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) told CNN Friday shortly after Trump’s tweet. ","dateModified":"2018-06-22T14:21:24.702Z","datePublished":"2018-06-22T13:59:00.000Z","headline":"Trump kills off House immigration bill he had vowed to support ‘1,000%'","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/172dabf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F28%2F2e8bab5ad2472ca1a11b4cef2be3%2Fla-lb-media-epa-rex-president-trump-discusses-immigr-9722831w-20180622-065003","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Eli Stokols"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#trump-kills-off-house-immigration-bill-he-had-vowed-to-support-1-000"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"In a billion-dollar victory for states, the Supreme Court ruled Thursday, 5-4, that states may impose sales taxes on internet businesses, even if they don't have physical locations in that state.Read More","dateModified":"2018-06-21T14:59:12.950Z","datePublished":"2018-06-21T14:24:00.000Z","headline":"Supreme Court sides with states to permit online sales taxes","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Los Angeles Times Staff"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#supreme-court-sides-with-states-to-permit-online-sales-taxes"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageA 2-year-old girl, with red sneakers and dark hair, crying as a U.S. Border Patrol agent searches her mother.

That suggests, as some of Trump’s advisors have said, that the policy was popular with his voters even as it was clearly political trouble for Republicans in some swing congressional districts. A poll by Quinnipiac University, taken June 14-17, found that the public opposed separating parents from children by 27%-66%. Republicans in that poll supported the policy 55%-35%, while Democrats opposed it 91%-7%.“As you may know, some families seeking asylum from their home country cross the U.S. border illegally and then request asylum. In an attempt to discourage this, the Trump administration has been prosecuting the parents immediately, which means separating parents from their children. Do you support or oppose this policy?” that poll asked.A survey by YouGov for the Economist magazine asked a simpler question and got similar results.“Do you approve or disapprove of separating families from each other, including minor children, when the adults are arrested for crossing the border into the United States without proper documentation?”  that poll asked.That poll found that Trump voters from the 2016 primary supported separation, 68%-23%. Those who voted for some other Republican in the primaries were more closely divided, with 50% supporting and 42% opposed. Those who voted in a Democratic primary opposed the plan with 16% in support and 78% against.That poll was taken June 3-5, before the policy became the subject of intense controversy.Two other surveys, one by the IPSOS polling firm for the Daily Beast website and one by CNN, found similar results — slightly more than a quarter of the public in favor of the policy, and about two thirds opposed. ","dateModified":"2018-06-20T22:45:26.217Z","datePublished":"2018-06-20T22:21:00.000Z","headline":"The public widely rejected Trump’s family separation policy, polls found","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/689da2a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+120/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5f%2Fc7%2F0e6ca119e5c2000d6aec7c7059ad%2Fla-lb-media-apphoto-trumpimmigration1-20180620-150513","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"David Lauter"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#the-public-widely-rejected-trumps-family-separation-policy-polls-found"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageIn a rare retreat to dispel outrage about his “zero tolerance” policy at the southern border, President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order to end a six-week-old practice of separating children from parents illegally crossing into the United States.His directive seeks to keep families together in detention.

That makes Trump a bigger factor in the midterm than any president since Pew first asked the question during President Reagan’s first term.The new survey highlights how much the national, partisan contest now outweighs local issues in voters’ choice for Congress: Nearly three-quarters of voters on both sides of the partisan divide said they cared which party will end up controlling Congress — a significantly larger share than in previous elections.Read More","dateModified":"2018-06-20T21:18:30.443Z","datePublished":"2018-06-20T21:25:48.452Z","headline":"Voter interest in the midterm elections stands at a historic high with a singular focus — Trump","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8d55ed9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe2%2F4e%2F779a15efcc6a976949f8322ea0d1%2Fla-na-pol-midterm-election-poll-20180620","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"David Lauter"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#voter-interest-in-the-midterm-elections-stands-at-a-historic-high-with-a-singular-focus-trump"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe Trump administration announced Tuesday it is withdrawing from the U.N. body that oversees human rights around the globe, saying the 47-nation council has shown an “unconscionable” bias against Israel and a blind willingness to ignore abuse elsewhere.The decision to leave the U.N.

James Otero of U.S. District Court in Los Angeles for a restraining order barring Avenatti from discussing the matter with the news media.On Twitter, Avenatti called the request “a complete joke.” “Mr. Cohen and Brent Blakely can’t deal with the truth, the facts, and the law, so they have to resort to unethical, meritless motions,” he said.Cohen, who denies wrongdoing, is under federal criminal investigation in New York. Prosecutors are examining, among other things, his $130,000 payment to Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election to buy her silence on the alleged affair with Trump.","dateModified":"2018-06-15T15:34:01.293Z","datePublished":"2018-06-15T15:20:00.000Z","headline":"Michael Cohen requests gag order to silence Stormy Daniels’ lawyer Michael Avenatti","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/798bd07/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fac%2F06%2F918565bd8e44de75486376425d2f%2Fla-lb-media-apphoto-trumprussiaprobe21-20180615-080139","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Michael Finnegan"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#michael-cohen-requests-gag-order-to-silence-stormy-daniels-lawyer-michael-avenatti"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageSo-called sanctuary jurisdictions that decline to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement could be held liable for failing to detain people in the U.S. illegally for deportation proceedings, under draft legislation proposed Thursday by House Republican leaders.Under the bill, if local law enforcement officials do not comply with an Immigration and Customs Enforcement request to hold an immigrant who is in the country illegally, and that immigrant is released and later commits rape, murder or sexual assault of a minor, the victim or the victim’s family would be allowed to sue the jurisdiction, according to a draft of the bill released Thursday.President Trump frequently railed about violent crimes committed by people in the country illegally during the 2016 campaign, most notably the case of Kathryn Steinle, a San Francisco woman killed two years ago by a Mexican man who had been deported several times.Read More","dateModified":"2018-06-15T14:43:26.240Z","datePublished":"2018-06-15T14:51:28.059Z","headline":"GOP bill would let crime victims sue ‘sanctuary’ cities; critics decry ‘total political theater’","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/99e7b24/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe2%2F8a%2F5719fbfae1967e4ddcf81bd97413%2Fla-na-pol-immigration-sanctuary-city-20180615","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Sarah D.

I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13 to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained them for the purpose of order,\" he said.When CNN’s Jim Acosta asked White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to elaborate on the attorney general’s comments, the conversation turned tense.“Where does it say in the Bible that it’s moral to take children away from their mothers?” Acosta asked.Sanders said she wasn’t aware of Sessions’ comments, but said, “I can say that it is very biblical to enforce the law.”No law requires families to be separated. The administration recently adopted a new “zero tolerance” policy of criminally prosecuting all people caught trying to cross the border illegally, even those seeking asylum. When families are caught, the approach separates the parents who are held pending trial from their children, who are taken to different detention centers.

The settlement does not require the government to separate families who arrive together, and previous administrations have not interpreted it that way.Next week the House is expected to consider wide-ranging immigration legislation. Along with providing a legal solution for young people brought into the country illegally as children, the bill is expected to limit separating parents and children at the border.It’s not clear if the bill, which is still being written by GOP leaders, could get enough support to pass the House, or if it would be brought up in the Senate.The new zero-tolerance policy requiring prosecution of people arriving illegally at the border has driven up the number of immigrant children in government shelters in the nearly two months since it began.Previously, border agents tried to keep families together by sending all members to the same family detention facility.
