Then we all run out and are outraged, 'The cops shouldn't have shot him.' What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand? I wanted a piece of pound cake just as bad as anybody else.

No. You're going to embarrass your mother. You're going to embarrass your family.\" He also brought up single mothers and young people wearing their pants too low.

In July 2015, a judge released court documents revealing that Cosby admitted in 2005 that he got Quaaludes, a hypnotic sedative used recreationally as a party drug, with the intent of giving them to young women he wanted to have sex with. In the court documents, he said he had given Constand three half-pills of Benadryl but did not admit to giving her Quaaludes.</p><p><b><a class="Link"  href="/ct-timeline-of-allegations-against-bill-cosby-20150706-story.html#page=1"  target="_blank"   >Read more »</a></b></p><p> </p><p>2005</p><h3 class="benton-title timeline-title"><a class="Link"  href="/ct-timeline-of-allegations-against-bill-cosby-20150706-story.html#page=1"  target="_blank"   >Assault allegations are first made public</a></h3><p>The sexual assault allegations that resurfaced against Bill Cosby first became public in 2005 after Andrea Constand’s lawsuit.</p><p><b><a class="Link"  href="/ct-timeline-of-allegations-against-bill-cosby-20150706-story.html#page=1"  target="_blank"   >Read more »</a></b></p><p>2008</p><h3 class="benton-title timeline-title"><a class="Link"  href="/ct-timeline-of-allegations-against-bill-cosby-20150706-story.html#page=1"  target="_blank"   >Chloe Goins</a></h3><figure class="full left"><img src="https://www.trbimg.com/img-559eabd3/turbine/la-la-et-cosby-chloe-goins-la0025849924-20150114"><figcaption>(Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)</figcaption></figure><p>Chloe Goins, a model, meets with Los Angeles police in January to discuss her allegations that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008.
