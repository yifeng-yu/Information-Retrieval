I don't believe that there is inherent or dormant racism because of the amount of white academy members. On the academy stripping older members of their voting rights:\"I'm not 100% sure that taking votes away from academy members who have paid their dues and maybe are retired now and have done great service — maybe they've not won a nomination, which would have given them immunity to the new rules, but they have served proudly and this is their industry too — to strip their votes? I'm not 100 percent behind that.\"On the academy's other diversity commitments:\"I do think that what the academy is doing, in a proactive way, to open up the membership to diversity, I think that's very, very important. But it's not just the academy, and I think we have to stop pointing fingers and blaming the academy. It's people that hire, it's people at the main gate of studios and independents. It's the stories that are being told. It's who's writing diversity — it starts on the page. And we all have to be more proactive in getting out there and just seeking talent.\"","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:53:05.546Z","datePublished":"2016-02-11T21:01:01.452Z","headline":"Steven Spielberg’s weighs in on #OscarsSoWhite","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fc53c6d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/750x422+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fec%2F15%2F7c3bfeca931bdaa63705a96b4b3a%2F750x422","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-oscars-so-white-reaction-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-oscars-so-white-reaction-htmlstory.html#steven-spielbergs-weighs-in-on-oscarssowhite"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Image QuoteRead More","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:56:24.955Z","datePublished":"2016-02-09T01:00:59.378Z","headline":"Academy president acknowledges ‘elephant in the room’ at luncheon","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/558d56f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/750x422+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc0%2F1c%2F52c24f34d6a074b6031dac150650%2F750x422","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-oscars-so-white-reaction-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-oscars-so-white-reaction-htmlstory.html#academy-president-acknowledges-elephant-in-the-room-at-luncheon"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageCountless celebrities have thrown their voices into the conversation on diversity in Hollywood following the limited number of people of color on the Oscar nominee list for the second year in a row.

You've got to give a good performance, and I'm sure there were very good ... I don't know whether Idris got it, because I saw Idris [Elba, in 'Beast of No Nation,'] and I thought he was wonderful.

People will always say: ‘Him, he’s less handsome’; ‘Him, he’s too black’; ‘He is too white’ ... Someone will always be saying ‘You are too [this or that]' ...

Nowhere,\" he said. \"You can't go forward and backwards at the same time. Chris Rock will be the best thing for the movement for the Oscars, than even the people not showing up. Trust and believe, Chris Rock is too smart and courageous of a guy, and I think he should host the Oscars.\"Harvey went on to detail that Rock's comedy career has prepared him to effectively address the #OscarsSoWhite backlash.\"This is his gig. It's his career, it's his shot. He's a host. Chris Rock's not an actor, Chris Rock will never, ever get an Oscar. He knows that. Let the man do what he do, but he's going to say something that night that will be beneficial to a lot of people,\" he said.[Though Rock is an actor. He had a short stint on \"Empire\" and fronted films like \"Top Five\" and \"Down to Earth.\"]But don't expect to see Harvey on the carpet of the Academy Awards.“I’m going to help with the boycott; I'm not going,\" he told Access.

But when it comes to Oscar bait, the default remains too often set at literal reading of the four essential categories of conflict: Man versus man, man versus nature, man versus society and man versus himself. As many have already pointed out, the characters in the lead actor category were a writer, scientist/astronaut, tracker, inventor and artist. The characters in lead actress? Homemaker, mother/rape survivor, inventor, wife, clerk.Certainly \"Straight Outta Compton,\" \"Creed,\" \"Concussion\" and \"Beasts of No Nation\" fit the \"classic\" definition of literary conflict.
