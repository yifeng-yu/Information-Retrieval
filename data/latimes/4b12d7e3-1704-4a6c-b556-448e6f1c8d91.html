He took her to a banquet that evening and for a drink, where he expressed interest in helping her launch her singing career. He then invited her to a dinner party at the family home in Shelburne Falls, Mass., which turned out to be just a dinner for two, Steuer said. She got sick after half a drink, and woke up naked in a bed hours later. Cosby was standing over her, told her she got sick, passed out and he had to wash her dress. “And I believed him, I was so humiliated I thought I had embarrassed myself,” Steuer said. \"I thought he'd never call again.” But Cosby did call, checking in on her every few months, paying for an acting class and for a gym membership, because he said she needed to lose weight to have a career on screen. She went to two events with him without incident until he invited her to go to Atlantic City, N.J., in 1980. After she arrived, he asked her to visit his penthouse suite but wouldn't let her in the door unless she took a white pill he was holding that would “relax her,” Steuer said. She said she passed out and woke up feeling as if she had been penetrated. This time she confronted Cosby. She said he called her ungrateful and they never spoke again.

She said Cosby admitted he had given her a Quaalude and laughed at her. “He was wonderful to me; I never thought he would do that,” Emmons said. 1979 PJ Masten Masten was a Playboy bunny in her 20s when she met Cosby. She alleges that he drugged and raped her at the Whitehall Hotel in Chicago in 1979.
