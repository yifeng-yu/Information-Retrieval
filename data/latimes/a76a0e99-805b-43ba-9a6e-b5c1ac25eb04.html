        <p>What do L.A.'s top dogs say about our city? Los Angeles tracks licensed dogs for 100 ZIP Codes and tracks partial data for 28 more. A complete list of areas serviced by the city, including Beverly Hills, since 2009, can be found <a href="http://www.laanimalservices.com/laws-policies/animal-licenses/">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Although licensing pet dogs is required by L.A. city law, not all owners do. Licensing also does not guarantee the breed of a dog. For all we know, the Chihuahuas registered in Los Angeles could very well be a crowd of dalmatians. </p>

            <p align="left" margin-top="20px">Chihuahuas are perhaps the most iconic dogs in Hollywood. The breed experienced popularity in the 2000s thanks to their growing reputation as “purse” dogs. The population is still growing, nearly doubling in size since 2010. Unfortunately, our numbers do not show the homeless dogs in Los Angeles that would most likely show a growing trend of abandoned Chihuahuas. Managing the Chihuahua population along the West Coast has become so cumbersome that rescue organizations have previously <a href=http://www.latimes.com/tn-vsl-around-town-chihauhuas-and-pit-bulls-can-fly-20140828-story.html> flown their Chihuahuas east in order to give them a better chance at adoption.</a> <p>

                       <p align="Left">The Labrador retriever is the third-most-registered dog in Los Angeles with 9,116 registrations in 2016. It lags behind the German shepherd by only 262 dogs.<p>
            <p align="left" margin-top="20px">The Labrador retriever, while perhaps not as iconic a dog in Los Angeles as the Chihuahua, is certainly the most iconic dog in America, thanks to its reputation as an all-around family dog. They are known as a friendly breed, are outgoing and energetic, and come in a variety of colors. Despite their wholesome reputation, Labrador retrievers’ registration has declined since 2010.

            <p align="left" margin-top="20px">The ranking bolsters the idea that Los Angeles has a soft spot for mutts. This is a hard group to categorize, since mixed breeds are melting pots of their ancestors’ traits and features. Each dog is unique. They've showed the fastest growth of any dog on our list.

            <p align="left" margin-top="20px">Poodles are perhaps the best representation of Los Angeles. Their traditional coiffure is as iconic as L.A.'s image as the entertainment capital of the world. Perhaps this is the reason poodles are so popular (although their numbers are still dwarfed by the population of Chihuahuas in Los Angeles.) The poodle comes in three sizes: toy, standard and miniature. Of these sizes, the miniature poodle is the most popular with 4,929 registrations, making up more than half the poodle population in Los Angeles. One could assume that these smaller companions make better pets in a city as populated as Los Angeles.

                       <p align="Left">The pit bull is the sixth-most-registered dog in Los Angeles with 5,152 registrations in 2016. Many breeds can be classified as pit bull. For this ranking, we are only looking at dogs registered as pit bull.<p>
            <p align="left" margin-top="20px">Pit bulls are nothing new in Los Angeles. If we include the American Staffordshire terrier, a breed generally recognized as a pit bull, in the total, the pit bull would be the second-most-popular dog in Los Angeles. Similar to the Chihuahua, shelters in Los Angeles find themselves overcrowded with these dogs. This is in part because of their reputation as aggressive from being used in dog fights. Many dog-friendly places are not necessarily pit-bull-friendly. It is common for apartments and boarding facilities to charge extra for pit bulls or forbid them altogether. Nonetheless, the pit bull remains a top dog in Los Angeles.
