Pete Aguilar (D-Redlands) can take a bit of a breather. A new analysis by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which handicaps U.S. House races, shows seats held by Aguilar, Rep. Jim Costa (D-Fresno) and Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Palm Desert) were upgraded from \"likely\" to \"solid\" Democratic seats, thanks to their heavy Latino population. Cook defines \"likely\" seats as those that are not currently competitive but that have the \"potential to become engaged.\"That should be welcome news for Aguilar. He edged out his Republican opponent in 2014 by just 51.7% to 48.3% despite outspending him and benefiting from a Democratic advantage of 6 percentage points among registered voters in the district. \"As long as Trump or Cruz is the GOP nominee, this 52% Latino district is not going to be voting for a Republican,\" writes Cook Report House editor David Wasserman. Trump and Cruz could also affect the races for seats held by two Republicans in the Central Valley, Rep. Jeff Denham of Turlock and Rep. David Valadao of Hanford, as well as freshman Rep. Steve Knight in north Los Angeles County.Those districts still lean Republican, according to Cook's rankings, but Trump and his polarizing comments on Mexican immigrants could cause problems for the incumbents. \"The heavier the drag from the top of the ticket, the more expensive these types of seats will be to defend,\" Wasserman said.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:48:51.701Z","datePublished":"2016-03-19T00:44:04.520Z","headline":"Thanks to Trump, these House Democrats from California can breathe easier","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7b68f3a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F02%2F0b061e1646b5e6e7004313bcb7f5%2Fla-donald-trump-appeared-by-video-at-a-rally-in-jerusalem-20161026","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Javier Panzar"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html#thanks-to-trump-these-house-democrats-from-california-can-breathe-easier"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Few would have ever predicted that California, one of the most reliably Democratic states in presidential politics, would play a major role in the 2016 contest on the Republican side.And yet, that's exactly what looks to be in store come June 7.On this week's California Politics Podcast, we take a closer look at the fascinating inside dynamics of how Donald Trump, Texas Sen.

Pete Aguilar (D-Redlands) sent a letter to the Democratic National Committee last month asking that the city be considered as a host for a scheduled May debate in California between Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Now Paul Chabot, a Republican military veteran who is challenging Aguilar, is asking the Republican National Committee to bring the remaining GOP presidential candidates to San Bernardino, where 14 people where killed last December in the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11.In a letter to RNC chairman Reince Priebus, Chabot wrote that the city \"could have used a strong Republican president to avoid the attack we suffered.\"\"We have a unique opportunity to make sure that the communities affected by the attacks on December 2nd understand that a Republican president will fight for their protection, not drop-in after an attack on his way to Hawaii,\" Chabot wrote.Seventeen other politicians and local groups joined Chabot's call for a GOP debate, according to his campaign. TweetAsked to comment on whether the RNC is considering the request, a RNC spokesman referred to the online schedule of debates which does not include a future California debate and did not answer further questions. Chabot shouldn't get his hopes up: Fox News canceled a debate scheduled for Monday in Salt Lake City after Donald Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. both declined to participate.“I think we’ve had enough debates,” Trump told Fox News. “How many times can the same people ask you the same question?”Also not a plus: Chabot misspelled Priebus' first name in the letter calling the chairman, \"Rince.\"Chabot narrowly lost a 2014 contest against Aguilar to represent the then open 31st Congressional District seat and is angling for a rematch. He has made his career in the military and law enforcement the center of his campaign.Two other Republicans, economist Sean Flynn and former Congressman Joe Baca, are also hoping to make it out of a top-two June primary. Baca, a former Democrat, had previously said he was retiring from politics after losing two congressional bids in a row and suffering a landslide loss when he ran to be mayor of Fontana.  ","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:58:20.289Z","datePublished":"2016-03-18T00:42:36.420Z","headline":"This Inland Empire Republican wants a GOP presidential debate in San Bernardino","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ffc6725/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+148/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fca%2F6e%2F56edfd71caad12bca6158832ab4d%2Fla-na-politics-me-flynt-20161012","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Javier Panzar"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html#this-inland-empire-republican-wants-a-gop-presidential-debate-in-san-bernardino"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Tweet","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:58:15.853Z","datePublished":"2016-03-17T22:27:07.414Z","headline":"Trump is tops in ballot placement in California","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html#trump-is-tops-in-ballot-placement-in-california"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Two things should be debunked about Donald Trump: One is that he’s the new Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Ryan (R-Wis.) to file an amicus brief on behalf of the entire House chamber opposing President Obama's immigration orders.The resolution was approved by a 234-186 vote, with five Republicans voting against.The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments Friday in a case challenging President Obama’s immigration executive actions. A decision will probably come right before the court ends its current session in late June.Texas and 25 other states are seeking to nullify Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which defers deportation for certain immigrants who came to the United States as children, and his Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program, which defers deportation for their parents as well.Reps. David Valadao (R-Hanford) and Jeff Denham (R-Turlock), who have supported immigration reforms in the past, said they voted in favor of filing the brief because the president's executive actions went too far.\"This amicus brief is not about the issue of immigration. Nor is it about this president. It is about ensuring that the United States remains a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, regardless of whether Democrats or Republicans maintain control,\" Valadao said in a statement. \"President Obama’s attempt to go around Congress cannot stand. Not only does his action damage our ability to accomplish meaningful reform, but if left unchecked it allows future presidents to expand actions or reverse them altogether,\" Denham said in a statement.Last week, House Democrats — including all 39 in California's delegation — filed their own amicus brief supporting the president.Reps. Karen Bass (D-Los Angeles), Ted Lieu (D-Torrance) and Loretta Sanchez (D-Whittier) did not vote.

Pete Wilson in 1994 and championed a 1998 initiative to end bilingual education, said on Wednesday that he’s running for California’s open U.S. Senate seat.Unz, who lives in Palo Alto, called it an “absolutely, last-minute decision.” Unz led a short-lived initiative campaign in 2014 to increase California’s minimum wage to $12, and said the Senate campaign will give him another chance to “raise a lot of issues.” He said one of the main reasons he jumped into the race was, in part, the California Legislature’s effort to repeal his 1998 initiative, Proposition 227. Lawmakers have placed a measure on the November ballot to repeal the remaining provisions of the bilingual initiative, as support grows for promoting the teaching of two languages in dual-immersion classes.“It’s absurd,” said Unz. “It’s a very negative statement about politics in California.”Unz, who became wealthy in the software industry, said he plans to seed his campaign with $50,000 to $100,000 of his own money. He will also seek political donations, but with a cap of $99.Unz, who filed for office this week in Santa Clara County, said he is well aware that Democrats hold a daunting advantage over the GOP in voter registration in California, and that it has been almost a decade since a Republican won a statewide general election.“It’s not like I give myself a great chance of winning,” he said.Democrats Atty.

Gov. Gavin Newsom that would further restrict guns and ammunition in California.In a letter to be released Thursday, the Assn. of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles County joins the California State Sheriffs Assn., which earlier announced opposition to Newsom’s “Safety for All Act of 2016.''ADDA President Michele Hanisee said California already has the strictest gun laws in the nation and its requirements that guns be registered “have done nothing,” according to a copy of the letter obtained by The Los Angeles Times.She said that as a prosecutor she has never seen a gang member register the gun he used in a violent crime. Newsom’s measure, which must qualify for the ballot through the signature collection process, would require background checks for those who buy ammunition and ban possession of large-capacity magazines. “Like other misguided efforts before it, this initiative would make it prohibitively difficult for responsible gun owners to obtain ammunition to use in their firearms for sport, target and home defense,” Hanisee wrote. “It would do nothing to stop criminals from getting ammunition or larger-capacity magazines. The actual result is that it further incentivizes the criminals to commit residential burglaries and armed robberies of gun stores.” The sheriffs said in a previous letter that the initiative would not stop criminals from getting guns and ammunition on the black market. That letter was signed by Amador County Sheriff Martin Ryan, president of the association.Gun-owner groups have accused Newsom of using the initiative to advance his campaign for governor in 2018. Dan Newman, a spokesman for the initiative campaign, said Wednesday that the measure would improve public safety and clarify a law that makes stealing a gun a felony.“It's common sense — taking large-scale military-style magazines off the streets and preventing dangerous criminals from having guns and ammo will help law enforcement professionals protect the public,” Newman said.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:48:37.881Z","datePublished":"2016-03-16T21:35:18.752Z","headline":"L.A.

Exemptions could be made on a case-by-case basis, Murphy told the House Armed Services Committee, but the 1977 law that granted veteran status to women was unclear about burial at Arlington National Cemetery, he said. Burial of female veterans is allowed at other veterans cemeteries.“I know it is not the answer you want to hear, but that's the answer,” Murphy said.Murphy's answer didn't satisfy several members of Congress and the family of one of the pilots, who voiced their frustration in a news conference after the hearing.\"If they are not going to do it, we're going to make them do it,\" said Rep. Martha McSally, an Arizona Republican and former Air Force fighter pilot.Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Congress can't change history, but said it is \"able to change how these great women are honored. This is just something that has to happen.\"Murphy said he supports legislation to make the change.\"Congress needs to change what Congress did in 1977,\" he said. \"I can't change it unilaterally. ... The commander-in-chief can't.\"About 1,000 female pilots served stateside during World War II in the WASP program to free up male pilots for combat. They flew more than 60 million miles domestically, and handled test flights, repaired military aircraft and ferried male officers around the country. They even towed targets during live-ammunition training. Thirty-eight died while serving.In 2002, Arlington National Cemetery's administrator said that those who served in the WASP program were eligible for full military honors upon being buried there, and that the women had been eligible for burial there since 1977. But last year, the secretary of the Army overturned that decision, saying it was wrong.The family of pilot Elaine Harmon refused to accept that edict after Harmon's will instructed that she wanted to be buried in Arlington. The Army's decision came shortly before Harmon's death at 95, and her ashes remain on a shelf in her daughter's closet in Maryland. ImageErin Miller of Maryland said her grandmother wouldn't believe there is still a fight over whether the pilots were veterans 70 years after World War II.\"I'm still dealing with this problem, and she's not even here anymore,\" she said.The Harmon family started a Change.org petition that now has more than 170,000 signatures and drew the attention of McSally and other members of Congress.Rep. Susan Davis (D-San Diego) said Wednesday she's never seen so many House colleagues rush to sign on to co-sponsor legislation as when she explained who the Women Airforce Service Pilots were and pointed out the Army's refusal to allow their ashes to be placed in Arlington National Cemetery.\"All of these women were very patriotic and wanted to serve their nation in any way possible,\" she said. \"This one should be easy.\"So far, 180 members — including 17 Californians — have joined Davis in sponsoring the Women Airforce Service Pilot Arlington Inurnment Restoration Act, which was approved by the House Veterans Affairs Committee in February.Read More","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:48:33.852Z","datePublished":"2016-03-16T20:58:56.644Z","headline":"California members seeking Arlington burial for female WWII pilots","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/41520db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+155/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff3%2F16%2Fb91c5a6c4ed56cf88cb53fe6428a%2Fla-1476244362-snap-photo","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Sarah D.

It filed for bankruptcy in 2012.  ImageIn December, 14 people were killed in the attack on the Inland Regional Center.

He slammed Cook for voting to pass a federal budget in December that did not include a rider bill suspending the admission of new refugees from Syria and Iraq to the U.S.  “We need a Representative that will stand up for the people of this great district and speak out against the political correctness that has put us all at risk,” Donnelly said in a statement.After he came in third in the 2014 governor's primary race behind Gov.

Ben Hueso believes he’s going to lose his bid to beef up regulations on Uber, Lyft and other ridesharing companies.“Honestly, I don’t believe I can stop this,” Hueso, a Democrat from San Diego, said in an interview this week. “I don’t believe I can influence this. I can bring some more information to the public.”Hueso, one of the Capitol's strongest advocates for stricter ridesharing rules, said his colleagues are attracted by Uber and Lyft’s popularity and haven’t grappled with allowing the businesses to face fewer regulations than taxis and other transportation services. Hueso said his experience in the taxi industry has allowed him to see red flags related to public safety and consumer protection that others don’t. He said he’s also bothered by what he sees as inattention from legislators and regulators on the issue. The Public Utilities Commission is responsible for overseeing ridesharing companies. But this week, the head of the PUC told an Assembly committee that the commission might need to jettison its ridesharing responsibilities because they are too much work. “I’m just watching this, fascinated, [and] going, ‘What are we doing here as a Legislature?’” Hueso said. “If we are going to allow this business to flourish in our state, we definitely need regulation. If somebody dies, if consumers are not treated fairly, if the employees are not treated fairly, it’s really on our conscience.”Hueso's comments came during an interview for an article on his family ties to the taxi industry and why he hasn't scheduled votes in his Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee for two widely supported bills to ease some ridesharing regulations. His lack of action has put the two ridesharing bills on hold.

Jerry Brown last October, but its effective date was delayed because it was approved in a special session.The bill had failed to win support during the regular session.

Lois Wolk of Davis and Bill Monning of Carmel. “The End of Life Option Act ensures that terminally ill Californians will not be denied death with dignity,” the lawmakers said. “We are grateful that the law will soon be in effect.”Brown signed the bill even though he thought it was not appropriate to act on it in a special session called to find financing for healthcare programs.The approval of the law through “controversial legislative tactics” was denounced again Thursday by Tim Rosales of Californians Against Assisted Suicide.The group “remains strongly critical of this new law, and its lack of medical oversight and actual patient safeguards,” he said. “We will continue working with our partners including doctors, patients and disability rights organizations to educate those impacted and vulnerable, as well as working to limit the law’s harms and prevent any expansion.”","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:57:33.914Z","datePublished":"2016-03-10T18:48:06.597Z","headline":"State aid-in-dying law to take effect June 9","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1097690/2147483647/strip/true/crop/750x422+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff5%2F50%2F239d15ddba53f680056856c12757%2F750x422","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Patrick McGreevy"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html#state-aid-in-dying-law-to-take-effect-june-9"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe state Senate on Thursday gave final legislative approval to bills that would regulate electronic cigarettes and raise the smoking age to 21 in California, sending them to Gov. Jerry Brown for consideration.Senate leader Kevin De Leon (D-Los Angeles) called the six tobacco bills approved Thursday, “the most expansive tobacco control legislative package in over a decade.”Supporters of additional tobacco controls used the special session to advance bills that had bogged down during a regular session, moving them through new committees not controlled by opponents. The bills were approved last week by the Assembly. Most Republicans voted against both bills.The bill on electronic cigarettes bans their use in restaurants, theaters and other public places where traditional smoking is already prohibited. Sen. Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, said his bill also significantly prohibits marketing the devices to minors.Sen. Jeff Stone, R-Murietta, said there is concern that electronic cigarettes serve as a “gateway” to the use of regular cigarettes, especially for teenagers. “For the first time, more teenagers use e-cigarettes than cigarettes,” Stone said.Sen. John Moorlach, R-Costa Mesa, opposed the measure, saying it infringes on freedoms. “Everybody has the right and the freedom to smoke,” Moorlach said.The Senate also passed a measure by Sen. Ed Hernandez, D-West Covina, that would raise the legal minimum age for smoking in California from 18 to 21. Hernandez said the proposal will save lives because many fewer minors will take up cigarettes.The senator said “fierce” opposition to the bill by the tobacco industry shows that it relies on a business model “to market and sell this poison to our kids.”Sen. Joel Anderson, R-San Diego, opposed the bill, saying it would deprive people who return from war a chance to smoke. The bill exempts active military personnel.If the governor signs the bill, California would become the second state in the country, after Hawaii, to increase the age to buy tobacco products to 21,The Senate also approved four other tobacco bills, including measures increasing licensing fees for tobacco sales, allowing counties to seek voter approval of tobacco taxes, and expanding bans on smoking at schools as well as and workplaces to include warehouses, gambling clubs, motel lobbies, covered parking lots and other public areas left out of the existing law.Sen.

Currently, farmworkers receive overtime after working 10 hours in a day. Clinton, in a Feb. 29 letter to Gov. Jerry Brown, Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Paramount), said the bill builds on the state’s long history of protecting farmworkers. “I have been committed to our nation’s agricultural workers throughout my career, and I write to convey my strong support for this legislation,” Clinton wrote in the letter. “It reflects our shared commitment to fair and humane working conditions for those whose labor feeds our nation and much of the world.”Similar bills aiming at expanding farmworker overtime rules have failed twice in recent years, according to Gonzalez’s office. In 2010, then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a bill and the next year a bill passed both houses but failed after Senate amendments did not gain the support of the Assembly. Gonzalez’s bill differs from the prior attempts by phasing in the eight-hour workday over four years. Gonzalez said her understanding is that United Farm Workers asked Clinton to write a letter in support of the bill.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:50:05.895Z","datePublished":"2016-03-08T21:10:24.678Z","headline":"Hillary Clinton backs California farmworker overtime bill","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/39d3192/2147483647/strip/true/crop/750x422+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb7%2F29%2F20169330348bc23f3f6a8541bf82%2F750x422","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Liam Dillon"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html#hillary-clinton-backs-california-farmworker-overtime-bill"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"TweetLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti on Tuesday waded into the Supreme Court’s consideration of President Obama’s immigration executive actions when he and Democrats from more than 100 cities and counties filed a brief supporting the president.“This is not about politics as much as it’s about people, and it’s about promises,” Garcetti told reporters by phone. “We want to see cities that are prosperous, not that are picking up the failures of Washington.”Garcetti said the nation’s current immigration system hurts cities and counties economically because people work for low wages, can’t earn scholarships and access healthcare or are afraid to work with police. Obama's executive actions would make people in the country illegally feel more secure as they applied for citizenship, he said.Officials from 24 California cities and counties -- including Davis, Oakland, Sacramento, Santa Ana, San Francisco city and county, San Jose and Sonoma County -- signed on to the brief.Also on Tuesday, Atty. Gen.

A decision will likely come right before the court ends its current session in late June.Texas and twenty-five other states are challenging Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which defers deportation for certain immigrants who came to the United States as children, and his Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program, which defers deportation for their parents as well.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:53:28.402Z","datePublished":"2016-03-08T20:35:02.524Z","headline":"Garcetti, top state officials back Obama in Supreme Court immigration case","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Sarah D.

Jerry Brown wants California's Supreme Court justices to consider the strict mandates on the state's prison population as they weigh his November ballot initiative to overhaul parole and juvenile justice.On Monday afternoon, the governor's campaign attorneys filed new documents with a clear message: without the ballot measure allowing more inmates to be paroled, overcrowding will return.Almost two weeks ago, a Sacramento judge blocked Brown's parole initiative from gathering voter signatures, agreeing with a group of district attorneys that Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris should not accept the governor's last-minute major amendments to the measure. Brown immediately appealed to the state's highest court, and was allowed to begin gathering signatures while the legal issues are resolved.Last Friday, the panel of three federal judges warned that recent statistics show that the number of people behind bars is again rising. The judges wrote that the state must continue to prove that overcrowding solutions are \"durable, and such durability is firmly established.\"Brown clearly hopes that warning will bolster the case that his ballot measure can't wait for the next statewide election in 2018.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:46:06.178Z","datePublished":"2016-03-08T01:50:24.853Z","headline":"Don’t forget prison population woes, Brown urges in ballot measure fight","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/494b254/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0b%2F9d%2Fb633590f0916f187fd342703ce69%2F1600x900","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"John Myers"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html#dont-forget-prison-population-woes-brown-urges-in-ballot-measure-fight"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageAssembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, (D-Paramount) outlined three priorities for his tenure in his swearing-in speech Monday afternoon: poverty, oversight and participation.Poverty: Rendon called the number of California children living in poverty \"the single biggest shadow on the Golden State.\" In a news conference after his speech, Rendon referred to a recent successful effort to boost tax credits for poor working families and a potential minimum wage increase as specific anti-poverty measures. Oversight: With a potentially longer time in office than his predecessors because of the loosening of term limits in 2012, Rendon said he wanted to ramp up legislative oversight, specifically of the executive branch. He said he was hoping to work with his GOP colleagues in this area as well as on anti-poverty programs.Participation: Rendon said that when he was first elected in 2012, he received only 8,700 votes in a district with almost 500,000 people. \"It was really hard for me to consider that a win in 2012,\" Rendon said. \"And I think we need to explore how we can get more Californians involved.\"Rendon opened his speech talking about his background as a poor student who worked graveyard shifts to get ahead before he earned a Ph.D. in aesthetic and political theory from UC Riverside.

The state Political Reform Act prohibits candidates from accepting cash contributions of $100 or more, but Lopez admitted accepting five such contributions totaling $1,300, according to the report released by the FPPC’s enforcement staff.Campaign filings that detail the amounts raised and spent by a candidate were filed by Lopez with Los Angeles County on time, but three were late getting to the secretary of state’s office, with two not showing up until seven months after the election.Lopez also improperly paid $4,698 in campaign expenses from her personal funds rather than her campaign committee account, the FPPC report said.In addition, the report said Lopez and her campaign treasurer, Carolina Perez, failed to deposit approximately $800 in contributions received for two fundraisers selling tamales and papusas into the committee’s bank account.Lopez attributed poor record-keeping to a “lack of prior experience with the Act and due to lack of funds,” the report said.Candidates are also supposed to file a report detailing their personal financial investments, but Lopez failed to report rental property she owned, rental income from that property and her spouse’s salary. In all, she faced five counts alleging violations of the Political Reform Act.Failure to properly file the campaign finance reports “deprived the public of information regarding the committee’s finances,” the FPPC report said. “Additionally, because many of the transactions were in cash, the full nature and extent of the campaign activity cannot be verified with the available records.”In imposing fines, commission staff noted that Lopez had previously been fined $400 for failing to timely file two preelection campaign statements for the June 3, 2014, primary election. Mitigating factors include that Lopez filed some statements with the county registrar, that she cooperated with the investigation and that her campaign spent little money compared with most election efforts.“The Enforcement Division investigation did not reveal any evidence that Lopez, the committee, and Perez intended to conceal information from the public, and (they) contend that the violations were unintentional,” the investigative report said. “Lopez has since hired a professional treasurer to assist her in complying with the Act’s campaign requirements.”","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:59:17.633Z","datePublished":"2016-03-07T23:26:01.234Z","headline":"Assemblywoman Lopez faces fines for campaign, personal finance disclosure violations","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/02dc0af/2147483647/strip/true/crop/750x422+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F29%2F02%2F2cfa63ea4a0c9f5075ce354900cb%2F750x422","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Patrick McGreevy"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html#assemblywoman-lopez-faces-fines-for-campaign-personal-finance-disclosure-violations"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"I covered Reagan up close for 20 years, including as The Times' White House correspondent. The first lady had only one agenda — her husband's legacy.She became known as \"the bad cop.\"Read More","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:53:44.229Z","datePublished":"2016-03-07T23:12:04.951Z","headline":"Remembering Nancy Reagan","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"George Skelton"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html#remembering-nancy-reagan"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"The fact came up over and over again during Monday afternoon's swearing in of new Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Paramount): He can be here for a long time.Thanks to voter-approved changes to legislators' term limits, Rendon could be speaker for the next eight years -- longer than anyone since Willie Brown.

Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina), who wrote the bill raising the tobacco smoking age to 21.\"Medicinal marijuana requires a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider,” Hernandez said.Assemblyman Rob Bonta (D-Alameda), an author of legislation last year that created regulations for medical marijuana, agreed that it involves “cannabis as a medicine. That’s between a patient and a physician as to whether that is appropriate to address the ailments of a patient.”Some children under 18 have even been prescribed marijuana to address problems with epilepsy, Bonta said.The Assemblyman said regular smokers of marijuana may face some of the same health issues facing regular smokers of tobacco. He noted that a separate measure in the signature-gathering stage for the November ballot that would allow recreational use of marijuana requires the consumers to be 21 or older.“That is very consistent with what we passed on the floor yesterday in the Assembly,” Bonta said Friday.Read More","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:58:27.704Z","datePublished":"2016-03-04T19:16:41.033Z","headline":"Smoking-age change foes say it’s unfair since Californians can smoke pot at 18","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b32cd70/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+5/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6f%2F05%2Fc6ddb8b8ef56ed4365e934ef4c9b%2Fla-sp-connor-fields-20160819","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Patrick McGreevy"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html#smoking-age-change-foes-say-its-unfair-since-californians-can-smoke-pot-at-18"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageA San Francisco-based nonprofit says it will start rating proposals by California lawmakers as either \"for kids\" or \"against kids,\" and it's starting with a few on the table this legislative session.Common Sense Kids Action has designated seven bills as kid-friendly, including a proposal that would increase the benefit for paid family leave, another bill that would provide three months of maternity and paternity leave, and a bill that would extend online privacy laws to preschool students.

Assemblyman Adam Gray (D-Merced), who chaired the committee that blocked the similar bill, also voted against the bill. “Eighteen-year-old adults who can enlist in the military and serve and have all the other privileges of adults can decide for themselves” whether to smoke, Gray said.As a result, Wood agreed to amend the bill to exempt active-duty military personnel.Still, Republicans tried several failed attempts to block a vote by closing the special session. \"The governor did not call the second extraordinary session to debate the regulation of tobacco, \" said Republican Assemblyman Eric Linder, who said the special session was called to find new financing for healthcare. ","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:51:40.997Z","datePublished":"2016-03-03T18:54:31.868Z","headline":"Assembly votes to raise smoking age to 21","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/97e46d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/750x422+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6d%2F38%2Fca03b34b9a3da94fc29f76399efd%2F750x422","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Patrick McGreevy"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html#assembly-votes-to-raise-smoking-age-to-21"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Tweet Tweet Tweet","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:58:40.179Z","datePublished":"2016-03-03T18:53:03.496Z","headline":"Assembly passes bill to raise smoking age to 21","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html#assembly-passes-bill-to-raise-smoking-age-to-21"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Tweet","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:57:59.917Z","datePublished":"2016-03-03T18:23:35.946Z","headline":"Republicans try to block tobacco vote","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html#republicans-try-to-block-tobacco-vote"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Tweet","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:58:48.489Z","datePublished":"2016-03-03T18:04:09.867Z","headline":"Tobacco debate takes the Assembly floor","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html#tobacco-debate-takes-the-assembly-floor"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"California's pioneering family-leave law is one step closer to being more lucrative for workers.A measure by Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez (D-Echo Park) would increase how much workers — particularly those earning minimum wage — are paid when they take time off to care for a newborn or ailing family member. AB 908 legislation is the result of negotiations between Gomez and Gov.

Candice Miller (R-Mich.) answered questions from Library Deputy Director Colleen Shogan about how they got into politics and what Capitol Hill is like for female lawmakers.First elected in 2010, Hahn has said she is leaving Congress in January because she can have a bigger effect if elected to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Miller, who leads the House Administration committee and is currently the only female House committee chairwoman, is retiring after seven terms.Hahn said a Congress with more women would be friendlier. Women make up 20% of the House and 20% of the Senate.(California’s 53-member House delegation is 36% women. Both of the state's U.S. Senators are women.)Hahn and Miller said partisan rancor has made it harder to recruit women to run for office.“It’s a little more difficult now, and it’s not good. It’s not good for the country,” Miller said. Hahn said many women don't want to put their families through the scrutiny that comes with running for office, or be away from them for the workweek.Hahn said having other women in Congress to talk with, and occasionally commiserate about schedules and other matters, has made the job easier.Hahn and several Republican members hold a prayer meeting Wednesday mornings in the Lindy Claiborne Boggs Congressional Women’s Reading Room, the only room in the Capitol named for a woman.

He also sold his financial interest in Citizens Lanier Investors, a Delaware-based parking lot investment company, for between $10,000 and $100,000 in April.The report also stated that stock holdings in Emhoff’s individual retirement account, which “were funded prior to marriage,” were sold in March 2015.

That tax package was approved earlier this week. Now, legislators and anti-smoking advocates want the tobacco bills to be revived -- and quickly.“Our tobacco package has been on the [Assembly] floor since August. It’s time for a vote,\" said Sen. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina), who authored a bill to raise the smoking age. The question of whether to bring up the bills was the subject of the Assembly Democratic caucus' weekly meeting on Tuesday. Both Speaker Toni Atkins (D-San Diego) and incoming Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Paramount) voiced support for the measures, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussion who did not want to be identified discussing internal caucus matters.But others in the caucus have reservations about the proposals as well as objections over process. Assemblyman Adam Gray (D-Merced), who chairs a committee that blocked some of the tobacco bills during last year's regular session, said he was mostly supportive of the proposals but concerned about raising the smoking age and how the legislation would define an electronic cigarette.Gray is also concerned about the bills being taken up in special session, allowing them to be fast-tracked without following regular procedure.“I think bills should go through the appropriate process, which includes committee votes and appropriation and should not necessarily be done in special session,” he said, acknowledging that he felt the same way about the right-to-die legislation that he ended up ultimately supporting. Assemblyman Marc Levine (D-San Rafael), who supports the tobacco regulation measures, said he believed the bills should be put up for a vote on Thursday.The caucus “should let the world see who wants reasonable control on tobacco,” Levine said. The bills up for consideration all require a simple majority vote to pass. Proponents had originally sought a tobacco tax measure -- which would have required a two-thirds vote -- but have since pursued a ballot initiative for the tax hike.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:58:52.644Z","datePublished":"2016-03-03T00:39:29.897Z","headline":"Momentum builds in the Capitol for vote on stalled tobacco bills","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Melanie Mason"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Patrick McGreevy"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html#momentum-builds-in-the-capitol-for-vote-on-stalled-tobacco-bills"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageTwenty-one state legislators on Wednesday disclosed that they attended a conference in Maui last November that was paid for by a non-profit group funded by special interests including the oil industry and state worker unions.Public outrage over the annual event has sparked legislation that would bar lawmakers from accepting such travel paid for by those seeking favor at the Capitol and to require more sunlight on who is providing favors to legislators.The six-day conference hosted by the Independent Voter Project is held annually at the Fairmont Kea Lani resort, where rooms go for $365 or more a night, but lawmakers who have some of their expenses covered by IVP did not have to disclose them for months, under state law.Democratic Assembly members who went to Maui included Rob Bonta of Alameda, Cheryl Brown of San Bernardino, Nora Campos of San Jose, Jim Cooper of Elk Grove, Tom Daly of Anaheim, Mike Gipson of Carson, Adam Gray of Merced, Chris Holden of Pasadena, Reggie Jones-Sawyer of Los Angeles, Evan Low of Campbell, Jose Medina of Riverside, Sebastian Ridley-Thomas of Los Angeles, Freddie Rodriguez of Pomona and Tony Thurmond of Richmond. Republican Assemblymembers who made the trip include Assemblyman Frank Bigelow of O’Neals, Donald Wagner of Irvine and then-Republican leader Kristen Olsen of Modesto.Democratic Sen.

That means they might describe an asset as worth between $101,000 and $1 million, or more than $1 million, but not the precise amount. The requirements also mean it is impossible to report how much the person might be worth.On the newly released form, Newsom disclosed investments of more than $1 million in both Napa Valley winery businesses Airelle Wines Inc. and Villa Encinal Partners. He is president of Airelle.

Assemblyman Tom Lackey (R-Palmdale) opposed the measure, arguing that gun control laws “don’t have any meaningful impact on criminal behavior.”To give Gov. Jerry Brown a choice, the committee approved a second bill that would accomplish the same thing by saying that any rifle with detachable magazines are assault rifles banned from sale in the state. Those already owning such guns would have to register them with the state. The bill requires rifles to have fixed magazines that accept no more than ten rounds.Worley said many Californians already own guns with detachable magazines that would have to be registered with the state if the bill is approved.“You are going to have tens of millions of people in California who are going to be criminalized,” Worley said, noting Gov. Brown vetoed a similar bill last year.A third bill approved Tuesday would prohibit people from buying more than one long gun, or rifle, within any 30-day period. One California man bought 177 long guns on one day, officials said.The panel agreed to delay action for two weeks on a bill that would expand the definition of firearm to include unfinished frames that can be quickly converted to a functioning gun. Those “ghost guns” can be built without traceable serial numbers. Committee members said some definitions in the bill need to be refined.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:58:20.169Z","datePublished":"2016-03-01T20:07:44.622Z","headline":"Assembly panel backs gun bills in response to San Bernardino shooting","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Patrick McGreevy"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-20160301-htmlstory.html#assembly-panel-backs-gun-bills-in-response-to-san-bernardino-shooting"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"The House unanimously voted Tuesday to rename U.S. post offices in Camp Pendleton and Stockton. A bill sponsored by Rep.
