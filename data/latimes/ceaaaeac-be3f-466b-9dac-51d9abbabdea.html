Kim was considered by many to have an edge going into the race because of her name recognition and long history as a district staffer for Royce, who had endorsed her.Cisneros, who dominated the money race by pouring $9 million of his own funds into his first run for office, tried to use President Trump’s unpopularity to weigh down Kim’s bid, even registering a lookalike campaign web address that declared “Young Kim is Donald Trump.” Kim broke with Trump on several of his policies, including family separation at the border and curtailing family-sponsored visas.

Jeff Denham has lost a tight race against Democrat  Josh Harder in a heated race for the Central Valley’s 10th Congressional District.The seat was one of seven in California heavily targeted by national Democrats after the election of President Trump. Denham, 51, had previously beaten the odds in a district carried by Hillary Clinton and President Obama in the last two presidential elections.Harder, 32, an investor and former venture capitalist, spent most of the last decade going to school and working on the East Coast. But he was born and raised in the district and said he decided to take on Denham upon his return to stand up to Trump and protect residents’ healthcare.For years, Democrats have looked at the district that the three-term Republican congressman represents and seen winnable odds. The region, which takes in all of Stanislaus County and the southern portion of San Joaquin County, has a slightly higher share of registered Democrats than Republicans, and Latinos — who generally lean Democratic — make up nearly the same percentage of residents as non-Latino whites. But higher GOP turnout has given Republicans an edge.Until now, Denham had managed to keep a low national profile, more likely to be known among supporters at home as a fellow farmer committed to water and other agricultural issues. But Trump’s presidency thrust new attention on his farming credentials and policy decisions, including his middle-of-the-road approach to immigration.Harder attacked Denham for supporting the GOP tax bill and voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Denham attempted to cast Harder as a Bay Area outsider with little experience on one of the Central Valley’s key issues — water.Both oppose Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown’s delta tunnels proposal and had pledged to fight a plan by the Democrat-appointed state water board that could reduce the amount of water diverted from Northern California rivers for irrigation.Read More","dateModified":"2018-11-14T15:47:32.643Z","datePublished":"2018-11-14T02:34:00.000Z","headline":"GOP Rep.

But the national security strategist faced long odds in the Sierra Nevada district, home to the highest share of registered Republicans in the state. The sleepy region primarily covers Placer and El Dorado counties; it is anchored by Sacramento suburbs and stretches from Lake Tahoe in the north to Kings Canyon National Park in the south.Although activists have confronted McClintock, 62, at town hall meetings and protested outside his office, Republicans here hold a 13-point voter registration advantage. On Wednesday, he said his reelection victory proved his Sierra constituents valued minimum government interference, low taxes and secure borders.“These are the policies I have pursued in Washington and will continue to pursue with increased vigor and confidence — knowing that these positions are the clear and decisive will of the vast majority of voters in this district,” he said.The five-term incumbent helped pass the GOP tax plan, voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and advocated for stricter immigration enforcement. He also has challenged the scientific consensus on climate change and recently came under criticism for a campaign appearance with right-wing provocateur Dinesh D’Souza, who has promoted anti-Semitic and racist tropes.Democrats hadn’t been so excited about their prospects in the district since 2006. Morse outraised McClintock and finished the week before the race with nearly $1 million cash on hand that she poured into TV and digital ads, volunteer canvassing and more campaigning.Detractors accused her of inflating her resume. But Morse shrugged off the allegations and touted her record working for the military, the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. She said she wants to allow Americans to buy into the Medicare system, called for comprehensive immigration reform and emphasized protection of public lands in a district with four national parks.\"I went to bed last night filled with gratitude. While we didn't prevail at the polls, we built a foundation that strengthened our community and built a common vision for leadership that can dissolve the poisonous partisanship threatening our nation,” Morse said in a statement Wednesday.“In a moment in history where our country is being shredded by fear, anger, and partisanship, we rose up, and I am grateful to have been part of it.”UPDATES:6:03 p.m.: This story has been updated with comments from Morse.Nov. 7, 1:42 p.m.: This post was updated with comments from McClintock. This post was originally published at 10:47 p.m., Nov. 6.","dateModified":"2018-11-08T02:22:10.012Z","datePublished":"2018-11-08T02:03:00.000Z","headline":"GOP Rep.

David Valadao has outrun Democrat TJ Cox for a Central Valley seat that has long eluded Democrats despite favorable odds.California’s 21st Congressional District, which tilts against Republicans in terms of registered voters, was one of seven seats across the state targeted by national Democrats soon after the election of President Trump. But Valadao once more proved to be a formidable incumbent in a district that he won with more than 55% of the vote in his previous three elections.Democrats have struggled with ineffective campaigns and low voter turnout in the district, whose population is more than 70% Latino, that stretches across the rural parts of Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Kern counties. The nonpartisan handicapper Cook Political Report had labeled the race “likely Republican.”Valadao, 41, hails from a family of local Portuguese dairy farmers and has withstood Democratic challengers because of his focus on local issues such as irrigation and water storage. Like other Central Valley Republicans, he attempted to gain some distance from the president on immigration. But Trump placed attention on his otherwise GOP-aligned policy preferences, which Democrats attacked as deeply mismatched with the needs of his constituents.Cox, 55, was a late contender in the race after originally seeking to challenge neighboring Republican Rep. Jeff Denham. The businessman and engineer pushed Valadao on his voting record and what he called inaction on local issues.Shortly after the race was called, Valadao pledged to return to Congress to work on education and water issues.“The Central Valley has always been and will always be my home and I am beyond grateful for the opportunity to continue serving the place I love,” he said. Cox said he was proud of his campaign, and its “message of working for the people to deliver healthcare, jobs and opportunity.” UPDATES:4:22 p.m.: This post has been updated with a comment from Cox.Nov. 7, 2:04 p.m.: This post was updated with comment from Valadao. This post was originally published at 11:14 p.m., Nov. 6.","dateModified":"2018-11-08T00:41:39.845Z","datePublished":"2018-11-08T00:30:00.000Z","headline":"GOP Rep.

Scott Walker eyed a possible recount following the state's closest governor's race in more than half a century.The Evers victory, coupled with the apparent win by Democratic attorney general candidate Josh Kaul in a race too close to call, realigns the political dynamic in Wisconsin following eight years of Republican control. While Democrats had hopes of making headway in the Legislature, Republicans will remain in the majority with Evers as governor, setting up at least two years of divided government. That hasn't happened in Wisconsin since 2008, when Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle was in office and Republicans controlled the Assembly with Democrats in charge of the Senate.Evers declared victory early Wednesday morning, but Walker held off conceding while his campaign investigated 2,000 absentee ballots in Milwaukee that were reconstructed due to damage or errors. The city's elections commission said the reconstruction process is routine, transparent and overseen by representatives of both political parties, election workers and the public.With the unofficial count substantially complete, Evers led by about 31,000 votes, or 1.15 percentage points, which is just outside the margin at which a losing candidate may request a recount.Walker's first comment since the loss came via Twitter on Wednesday morning, when he posted a Psalm from the Bible: \"This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.\"Walker's defeat came amid record turnout for a midterm election in Wisconsin. More than 57% of the voting-age population — nearly 2.7 million people — cast ballots in the governor's race. Walker's loss was driven by massive turnout in the Democratic stronghold of Dane County, home to the state capital and University of Wisconsin main campus.But he also did worse elsewhere compared with 2014 — namely in the conservative Milwaukee suburbs that are vital for Republicans in statewide races. Those counties also came out less for President Trump in 2016 compared with Mitt Romney four years earlier.Walker's loss spells the end of what some called the \"Cheesehead Revolution.\" That described Walker, who ran for president in 2015, Rep. Paul Ryan's ascendance to House speaker and Reince Preibus' role as head of the Republican National Committee and, briefly, as Trump's chief of staff.","dateModified":"2018-11-08T04:42:41.487Z","datePublished":"2018-11-07T17:11:00.000Z","headline":"Wisconsin’s Democratic governor-elect faces a GOP-run Legislature; Scott Walker eyes a recount","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b876943/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F6d%2F2b64ced75a75f99d20ff4d2675c6%2Fla-lb-media-tonyevers-20181107-202410","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#wisconsins-democratic-governor-elect-faces-a-gop-run-legislature-scott-walker-eyes-a-recount"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageMajor U.S. stock indexes opened higher Wednesday after the uncertainty of a contentious midterm election ended with the most widely expected result: a Democratic takeover of the House and Republicans retaining the Senate majority.Despite President Trump’s contention last week that Democratic victories would lead to a stock market crash, the Dow Jones industrial average was up about 150 points, or 0.6%, on Wednesday.

We reject that.”If there has been any Central Valley congressional district with a shot of turning blue this election, it has been this one where Democrats hold a slight edge in registered voters and carried the last two presidential campaigns. And if there has been any candidate that supporters have believed could bridge the area’s growing urban-rural divide, it has been Harder.The 32-year-old former venture capitalist made his return to the place where he was born and raised, galvanizing Democrats over Republican Rep. Jeff Denham’s vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Over the past days, volunteers have poured in from across the state to walk precincts and knock on doors for his campaign. TweetBut Denham, 51, has long been a strong incumbent with wide support among farmers, veterans and white blue-collar voters. He has seized on Harder’s outside support to cast the 2018 election as a battle between the liberal values of the Bay Area and the conservative way of life of rural California.The candidates’ reflection of their changing parties and of the Valley was captured in their campaign signs.

Harder’s were smaller, usually found in subdivisions encroaching on that farmland.Those differences also were on display Tuesday at their election watch parties — Denham’s at a barn near Salida, Harder’s at a restaurant in downtown Modesto — and in the demographics of their attendees.At Harder’s event, cumbias blasted from the speakers and the crowd was jubilant, though the race remained tight and was likely to remain uncalled for days.

Scott Walker on Tuesday, denying the polarizing Republican and one-time presidential candidate a third term and succeeding where his party had failed in three previous attempts, including a 2012 recall.Evers' victory is a monumental win for Democrats and a steep fall for Walker, who just three years ago was seen as an early front-runner in the GOP primary for president. When Walker dropped out of the presidential race, he focused on rebuilding his low approval ratings in Wisconsin.Walker had promised if he won the third term would have been his last, but voters decided that two was enough.Evers, 67, a former teacher and state superintendent since 2009, used his folksy, nondescript personality to his advantage in the campaign, using words like \"jeepers\" and \"holy mackerel\" while arguing that voters were tired of divisiveness and yearned for more collegial politics.The win gives Democrats a boost after President Trump narrowly carried Wisconsin by less than 1 point in 2016. It also puts Evers in position to dismantle much of what Walker and Republicans did over the past eight years, including rolling back portions of the law that effectively ended collective bargaining for public workers.Democratic voters were ecstatic about ousting Walker.\"Tony Evers provides us with a new direction that a lot of people want to go,\" said Danielle Moehring, 27, a scientist from Madison.Moehring said she thought anger over Trump was motivating people to \"come out of the woodwork,\" get involved and vote.Ellen Martin, a 67-year-old retired occupational therapist from Madison, said she voted for Evers because he will \"save our state, especially the environment, education.\"Martin said she thought voters in Wisconsin were tired of Walker after eight years in office.\"I never liked him,\" Martin said. \"He's shamed our state, embarrassed our state, ruined our politics.\"Evers, a cancer survivor, campaigned on supporting the national health care law and its guarantees of coverage for people with preexisting conditions. He also promised to cut middle class taxes by 10 percent, paid for by all-but repealing a manufacturing and agriculture tax credit program Walker enacted. Evers is also open to raising the gas tax to pay for road repair and construction, although he hasn't released a specific plan.Walker, the 51-year-old son of a Baptist preacher, swept into office in 2010, part of a Republican wave that saw the GOP take over control of the state Legislature as well. With Republican partners in the Statehouse, Walker pushed through a law that effectively ended collective bargaining for teachers and most public workers.Anger over that law led to the failed 2012 recall election. Walker's stature among conservatives and national profile skyrocketed after the union fight and the passage of a host of Republican priorities, including making Wisconsin a right-to-work state; cutting taxes by $8 billion; implementing a voter ID law; expanding the private school voucher program statewide; freezing tuition at the University of Wisconsin; rejecting federal Medicaid expansion money under the Affordable Care Act; and restricting access to abortion.Walker ran for president in 2015, but dropped out before any votes were cast, out of money and down in the polls. His voter approval rating in Wisconsin dropped to its lowest levels.Last year, working closely with the Trump administration, Walker signed a deal with Taiwan-based Foxconn to build a display screen factory in the state that could result in $10 billion in investments and 13,000 jobs. He's pointed to that as signs of the state's economic recovery.Evers wants to renegotiate the deal, saying the potential $4 billion in state and local tax breaks for the Taiwan-based company is too much. Evers has also vowed, on his first day in office, to withdraw Wisconsin from a federal lawsuit seeking repeal of the Affordable Care Act.","dateModified":"2018-11-07T08:15:05.948Z","datePublished":"2018-11-07T08:02:41.000Z","headline":"Democrat Tony Evers defeats Wisconsin Gov.

Jared Polis on Tuesday defeated Republican state Treasurer Walker Stapleton in the Colorado governor’s race, keeping the seat in Democratic hands. ImagePolis will succeed the term-limited John Hickenlooper to become Colorado’s first openly gay governor. The 43-year-old is a five-term congressman and technology entrepreneur who promised to fight for universal healthcare, renewable energy standards and publicly funded preschool and kindergarten. He vowed to stand up to President Trump’s efforts to dismantle former President Obama’s healthcare law.Stapleton is a two-term state treasurer who campaigned on defending Colorado’s constitutional restrictions on taxing and spending. The 44-year-old Stapleton insisted that Polis’ ideas for funding K-12 education, roads and energy would bankrupt the state.Colorado has not had a Republican governor since 2007. The state has one of the nation’s lowest unemployment rates and highest rates of economic growth, largely fueled by the tech, aerospace and oil and gas industries.Polis banked on defending Obama’s healthcare law and riding a wave of anti-Trump sentiment in a state that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and saw overwhelming Democratic turnout in June’s party primaries.Stapleton sought to court unaffiliated voters, Colorado’s largest voting bloc, by insisting that Polis would jeopardize economic growth with costly and ill-defined proposals to fund schools and roads and expand healthcare.Stapleton portrayed himself as a defender of conservative fiscal policies that underlie that growth. Polis repeatedly promised to build bipartisan coalitions to invest in underfunded roads and public schools — suggesting the time has come to ask Colorado residents to loosen their strict constitutional limits on taxes and spending.Healthcare was a top issue in the race. Many Colorado rural and mountain towns pay some of the nation’s highest insurance premiums — and have only one provider — under the Affordable Care Act.Polis, endorsed by single-payer healthcare proponent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, unapologetically called for universal healthcare coverage as a long-term goal and suggested a first step might be to create a regional market with neighboring states.Stapleton praised Trump’s elimination of tax penalties for those without health insurance but said he would defend an expanded Medicaid program that covers 1 in 4 Colorado residents.Trump endorsed Stapleton, who embraced the administration’s antipathy toward so-called sanctuary cities that don’t closely cooperate with federal immigration authorities. But Stapleton sought to distance himself from Trump in the campaign’s final weeks, arguing that Trump’s scornful tweets about immigrants, women and minorities had no bearing on policy in the governor’s race.“I’m not going to sit here and defend President Trump’s personality,” Stapleton said in one debate.Citing the threat of climate change to Colorado’s outdoors industry, Polis proposed a 100% renewable energy standard for Colorado by 2040. Stapleton attacked the goal, saying it would harm Colorado’s $31-billion oil and gas industry. Polis, who raised the ire of the fossil fuels industry by once supporting limits on drilling, insisted the green standard was a goal, not a mandate.On abortion, Polis insisted that he would guarantee women’s right to choose if a conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court were to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a nationwide right to abortion. Stapleton said he would be a “pro-life governor” who would respect Roe as “the law of the land” but didn’t say what he would do if the decision were overturned.As Stapleton trailed in the polls, he tried to argue that his opponent acted aggressively toward a woman in a 1999 workplace incident in which Polis, then 24, tried to stop a female employee from stealing documents from a company he ran. Police and prosecutors concluded Polis was the victim of theft and did nothing wrong.","dateModified":"2018-11-07T14:50:01.563Z","datePublished":"2018-11-07T04:49:00.000Z","headline":"Jared Polis to become Colorado’s first openly gay governor","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/605c313/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x576+0+80/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcd%2F56%2Fd7c9adf43e140098f8fba3b4a3b3%2Fla-lb-media-ap18307721595562-20181106-204702","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#jared-polis-to-become-colorados-first-openly-gay-governor"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe first two Muslim women were elected to the U.S. House. Democratic Minnesota state legislator Ilhan Omar won her race in Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District and former Michigan state Rep.

Kevin Yoder in the state’s 3rd Congressional District.The governor’s race was seen less a referendum on Trump than on Brownback, who passed a large tax cut in 2012 that destabilized the state government’s finances and made him deeply unpopular.Kobach, the current secretary of state and a news-making firebrand known for hardline stances on immigration and voting requirements, had enjoyed near-universal name recognition in the state but also carried a large unfavorable rating. He supported reinstating the Brownback tax cuts, which were reversed by the state Legislature last year after moderate Republicans seized power from their more conservative counterparts.For the Record, 5:38 a.m. Nov. 7: An earlier version of this post referred to Sharice Davids as a former WWE fighter.

The serene setting is in contrast with other polling places not just across Los Angeles County but countrywide, where there have been reports of lines snaking around street corners, malfunctioning machines and other problems hindering voters from casting their ballots. The “Midterm Elixir” is a hand-blended tea that includes minty and floral notes and was created solely for Tuesday’s election. Additionally, lavender plants and olive branches decorated the table where the tea and sandwiches were laid out. Another sign of the efforts to create a tranquil environment.Sarah Clark, executive manager at the hotel, said previous elections have included yoga sessions, sitar players and a harp player. “It's one of the most stressful days of the year, but this year, for the midterm elections, there's been nothing like it, in terms of the stress levels,” she said.Efrem Harkham, chief executive and chairman of Luxe Hotel, came up with the idea hoping that voters would not only feel less anxious about the voting process but welcomed by a neighbor. “His whole idea is no one should ever vote on an empty stomach, and it really is about being here for the community and make it as stress-less as possible,” Clark said.Just how different was this election for Luxe Hotel? For the first time it had people waiting in line to vote before the polling place opened. Usually, the lines begin to form by 8 a.m., Clark said. “The traffic was terrible, I was rattled and angry,” said Henry, a 30-year resident who declined to give his last name. “There's almost an academic understanding of what you're doing and then you come here and it's like a zen corridor. I look forward to coming here. I just love relaxing in this place.”Eating a chicken salad, 50-year-old Josh Davis said he looked forward to voting at the polling place.  “I consider myself very lucky,” Davis said. “It makes you want to go out and vote, and I also love it because my son also sees it’s not as stressful when you do.”Among the issues he considered important was the superintendent of public instruction. As for the governor's race, he said he went with Gavin Newsom, a candidate he and his wife feel would be more effective at running California.","dateModified":"2018-11-07T03:48:46.717Z","datePublished":"2018-11-07T03:30:00.000Z","headline":"Voting at the Luxe on Sunset Boulevard with some ‘Midterm Elixir’ tea","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/acbac9e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1080+0+100/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8a%2F71%2Fb7f13f710c96453edf72c9aa819e%2Fla-lb-media-3063934-pol-election-day01-als-20181106-084827","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#voting-at-the-luxe-on-sunset-boulevard-with-some-midterm-elixir-tea"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageHours before polls closed on Tuesday, President Trump already was blaming retiring Speaker Paul D.

Marsha Blackburn won a grueling, expensive contest Tuesday to become the first female U.S. senator from Tennessee, keeping a key midterm seat under GOP control.The congresswoman defeated Democratic former Gov. Phil Bredesen by closely aligning her bid with President Trump, who drummed up support for her during three visits to the state that he won by 26 percentage points, including a rally in Chattanooga two days before the election.Blackburn’s win represents a rightward shift from the retiring GOP senator she will replace, Bob Corker, who fell in line with Tennessee’s historical preference for more-centrist senators and at times was a vocal critic of Trump.Blackburn worked to undermine Bredesen’s popularity and reputation as an independent thinker by tying him to national Democrats at every turn. She rarely diverged from Trump and touted his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall and tax cuts while blasting Bredesen’s opposition to both. She backed Brett Kavanaugh for Supreme Court the same day Trump nominated him and criticized Bredesen for taking so long to say he would have supported Kavanaugh’s confirmation as well.First elected to the House in 2002, Blackburn aligned with the tea party movement and regularly appeared on Fox News. She opened her campaign by dubbing herself a “hard-core, card-carrying Tennessee conservative.” Before that, she made a name for herself as a state lawmaker who helped lead the revolt against a proposed Tennessee income tax in the early 2000s.The pricey race set a state record in spending by candidates and outside groups, gaining national interest because of its potential implications for the GOP’s slim majority in the Senate.Pop superstar Taylor Swift even broke her political silence for the Tennessee contest when she went on Instagram to endorse Bredesen and encourage people to vote.Blackburn took aim at Bredesen for donating to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and receiving campaign checks from high-profile Democrats. Although Bredesen largely kept his distance from other well-known Democrats, Blackburn had no qualms bringing Trump and fellow national Republicans to Tennessee.She welcomed in Vice President Mike Pence twice. The president’s son Eric Trump and U.S. Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina also came along for separate campaign events.Corker, the outgoing senator, had backed Blackburn but refused to campaign against Bredesen, whom he considers a friend. Corker briefly heard out pleas from some peers last winter that he reconsider retirement, prompting a Blackburn spokeswoman to say anyone who thinks she can’t win the general election is a “plain sexist pig.”Afterward though, she managed to consolidate support across the GOP’s various political circles, including from former U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher, who briefly opposed her in the primary and called for Corker to run again upon dropping out of the race.","dateModified":"2018-11-07T14:47:55.263Z","datePublished":"2018-11-07T03:20:00.000Z","headline":"Blackburn wins Tennessee Senate race, keeping seat for GOP and becoming the state’s first female senator","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8698908/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+109/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F11%2Fb4%2Fc53cc2d8da24a69e5c20d40b83d2%2Fla-lb-media-apphoto-election2018senateblackburntennessee3-20181106-191244","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#blackburn-wins-tennessee-senate-race-keeping-seat-for-gop-and-becoming-the-states-first-female-senator"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Caregiver Phuong Le rushed out of the house to run errands Tuesday morning, checking off her top task: hand-delivering her ballot to the Westminster Library polling station.“I have to make sure it is not lost.

In the network poll, 56% said the country was on the wrong track, compared with 41% who said it was headed in the right direction. About two-thirds of voters in both surveys said that President Trump was a major factor in their vote.Nearly 40% of voters cast their ballots to express opposition to the president, according to AP VoteCast, a national survey of the electorate; about 25% said they voted to express support for Trump.In the network poll, 54% disapproved of Trump’s job performance and 47% strongly disapproved, compared with 44% who approved. The share who strongly disapproved of the president was several points higher than the share who felt that way about President Obama in 2010, when his party lost control of the House.About 1 in 4 voters in the network poll said their vote expressed support of Trump, and about 4 in 10 said their vote was in opposition to him.Nationally, the electorate was more diverse than in past midterms. Nonwhite voters accounted for 28% of those casting ballots, according to the preliminary results of the network exit poll. In 2014, nonwhite voters made up 25% of the electorate. The racial makeup of the electorate more closely resembled a presidential election than a midterm, the exit poll indicated.Both polls showed that healthcare was the top issue on voters’ minds.

But two years after an election that proved polls and prognosticators wrong, an air of uncertainty — and stormy weather across parts of the country — clouded the outcome of high-stakes elections from Florida to Alaska and everywhere in between.Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts easily won reelection as they consider bids for the Democratic presidential nomination. Other 2020 prospects on the ballot included New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.Anxious Republicans privately expressed confidence in their narrow Senate majority but feared the House was slipping away. The GOP's grip on high-profile governorships in Florida, Georgia and Wisconsin were at risk as well.\"Everything we have achieved is at stake,\" Trump declared in his final day of campaigning.Long lines and malfunctioning machines marred the first hours of voting in some precincts, including in Georgia, where some voters reported waiting up to three hours to vote in a hotly contested gubernatorial election. More than 40 million Americans had already voted, either by mail or in person, breaking early voting records across 37 states, according to an Associated Press analysis.Nearly 40% of voters cast their ballots to express opposition to the president, according to AP VoteCast, a national survey of the electorate, while 1 in 4 said they voted to express support for Trump.The nationwide survey indicated that nearly two-thirds said Trump was a reason for their vote.Overall, 6 in 10 voters said the country was headed in the wrong direction, but roughly that same number described the national economy as excellent or good.Two issues were on voters' minds more than any others: 25% described healthcare and immigration as the most important issues in the election.Trump encouraged voters to view the first nationwide election of his presidency as a referendum on his leadership, pointing proudly to the surging economy at recent rallies.He bet big on a xenophobic closing message, warning of an immigrant \"invasion\" that promised to spread violent crime and drugs across the nation. Several television networks, including the president's favorite Fox News Channel, yanked a Trump campaign advertisement off the air on the eve of the election, determining that its portrayal of a murderous immigrant went too far.The president's current job approval, set at 40% by Gallup, was the lowest at this point of any first-term president in the modern era. Both Presidents Obama's and Clinton's numbers were 5 points higher, and both suffered major midterm losses of 63 and 54 House seats, respectively.Democrats needed to pick up two dozen seats to seize the House majority and two seats to control the Senate.All 435 seats in the U.S. House were up for reelection, although fewer than 90 were considered competitive. Some 35 Senate seats were in play, as were almost 40 governorships and the balance of power in virtually every state legislature.Trump spent Tuesday at the White House, tweeting, making calls, monitoring the races and meeting with his political team.He and First Lady Melania Trump were to host an evening watch party for family and friends. Among those expected: Vice President Mike Pence and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, an informal advisor to the president.Democrats, whose very relevance in the Trump era depended on winning at least one chamber of Congress, were laser-focused on healthcare as they predicted victories that would break up the GOP's monopoly in Washington and state governments.The political and practical stakes were sky-high.Democrats could derail President Trump's legislative agenda for the next two years should they win control of the House or the Senate. Perhaps more important, they would claim subpoena power to investigate Trump's personal and professional shortcomings.Some Democrats have already vowed to force the release of his tax returns. Others have pledged to pursue impeachment, although removal from office is unlikely so long as the GOP controls the Senate or even maintains a healthy minority.Tuesday's elections also tested the strength of a Trump-era political realignment defined by evolving divisions among voters by race, gender, and especially education.Trump's Republican coalition is increasingly older, whiter, more male and less likely to have a college degree. Democrats are relying more upon women, people of color, young people and college graduates.Women voted considerably more in favor of their congressional Democratic candidate — with fewer than 4 in 10 voting for the Republican, according to VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 113,000 voters and about 20,000 nonvoters — conducted for the AP by NORC at the University of Chicago.In suburban areas where key House races will be decided, voters skewed significantly toward Democrats by a nearly 10-point margin.The demographic divides were coloring the political landscape in different ways.Democrats were most optimistic about the House, a sprawling battlefield set largely in America's suburbs where more educated and affluent voters in both parties have soured on Trump's turbulent presidency, despite the strength of the national economy.Democrats faced a far more difficult challenge in the Senate, where they were almost exclusively on defense in rural states where Trump remains popular. Democratic Senate incumbents were up for reelection, for example, in North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri — states Trump carried by almost 25 percentage points on average two years ago.History was working against the president in the Senate: 2002 was the only midterm election in the last three decades when the party holding the White House gained Senate seats.Democrats boasted record diversity on ballots.Three states could elect their first African American governors, while several others were running LGBT candidates and Muslims. A record number of women were running for Senate, House, governorships and state legislative seats.","dateModified":"2018-11-07T01:50:28.331Z","datePublished":"2018-11-07T01:28:00.000Z","headline":"Half of polls are closed as voters pit Trump strength against Democratic resistance","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8d14640/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+108/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6d%2Ff0%2F2c91a6ca8f044e52633a9d48f193%2Fla-lb-media-ap18310608431233-20181106-172702","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#half-of-polls-are-closed-as-voters-pit-trump-strength-against-democratic-resistance"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageJessy Nguyen, 25, knew he would be away at school when the election rolled around. So, during a summer filled with volunteer work in California, the Anaheim resident began studying ballot measures and the personalities behind the state’s diverse regional and local races.“Honestly, the president is not a factor in my votes, not at all,” said Nguyen, a master’s candidate in public policy at the University of Chicago. “The narrative that he’s perpetuating is very violent and many times, he’s targeted communities of color.“I don’t want to be part of that and I just try to block out what he’s saying,” he said.Nguyen, a premed student as an undergraduate at UCLA, says he’s concentrating on learning more about health policy now and researching ways more people can get easier access to healthcare. His inspiration for voting is that “I always want to fulfill my civic duties as a citizen. My motivation is that I believe my one vote matters. You can’t think ‘I’m just one vote’ and feel defeated because that can cause a domino effect. We all have incentives to vote.”Issues that grab hold of his heart are those that involve anti-poverty measures. “We should pay attention to those who are marginalized — fight for their needs. For example, if tenants can have good health insurance, then they spend less on insurance and the money they save can be applied to rent,” Nguyen said.He mailed his absentee ballot from Chicago and is eager to see local results starting tonight. Nguyen, who did not vote for Trump, says he thinks legislators working with Trump would find it difficult “if you don't conform to what he believes.

Celebrities including Melissa Etheridge and Debra Messing sprang into action to help organize Lyft rides and buses for any voters who needed transportation. Organizers from across Kansas — and as far away as San Diego — rushed in to help volunteer on the front lines.But on election day Tuesday, those transportation fears fizzled dramatically as volunteer buses and carpools stayed idle in Dodge City, and activists and residents agreed that the controversy had become overblown.“The national story doesn’t really appear to be the real story on the ground,\" said Edgar Pando, a Dodge City attorney who provides legal aid to low- and middle-income Kansans. \"People sort of extrapolated a meaning that wasn’t there, outside looking in, and that seems to be the general consensus.”As of early afternoon, only about 10 or 15 voters mistakenly showed up to the old Civic Center polling station in Dodge City, where get-out-the-vote organizers loitered in an empty parking lot, bashfully waiting for someone to help.Nancy Yost — who lives on the opposite side of the state, in Lawrence — with two of her friends, had rented a full-size tour bus to help voters get to the polls, drawn by the stories about the Dodge City polling place drama.But on Tuesday afternoon, she sat in the empty bus, which had been sitting idle in the Civic Center parking lot all day. But she didn’t regret the decision.“Our intention was to come and help people, if they needed help, to overcome an obstacle, and it’s still an obstacle, and — so be it,” Yost said. “It’s OK.” She declined to say how much the bus cost. “We felt that it was a good thing to do, and so we chose to do it.”Similar feelings had overcome Stephen Ruttinger, 70, and Eunice Ruttinger, 71, husband and wife, who also came from Lawrence to volunteer with the local Democratic Party to help get voters to the polls.Stephen Ruttinger — who wore a “Vietnam Veteran” hat that said “Don’t let the gray hair fool you, we can still kick ass” — grew tearful as he started talking about his military service as the reason he volunteered to help get out the vote.“I’m a Vietnam vet, and allegedly, I put it on the line for this,” Ruttinger said, his voice halting as he spoke while standing in the gravel parking lot outside the polling location. “It moves me a little bit, I guess.”One of the voters to accept a ride to the polls was Diego Marquina-Mendez, 18, who rode over from Dodge City Community College to vote for the first time.His parents immigrated from Mexico and can’t vote, and “they kind of bugged me about it, about how I have the responsibility to vote, and I should do that,” said Marquina-Mendez, who said he and his family have been turned off by President Trump’s stances on immigrants.But Marquina-Mendez had trouble getting his friends and classmates interested in voting. “I feel like maybe more people should try to get informed about voting, because I have some friends who didn’t really register to vote,” he said.Past voter turnout from Dodge City’s Latino residents has been abysmally low, and for several hours in the late morning and early afternoon Tuesday, the voters who showed up at Dodge City’s polling station were overwhelmingly white. The problem wasn’t a lack of buses. The problem is that the area’s Latino population has been “disenfranchised,” said Johnny Dunlap, the Ford County Democratic Party chairman.“By the numbers we have, the registered Hispanic voters in Dodge City only show up at the polls in the midterms at a rate of about 17%,” said Dunlap. “So there’s something wrong, right? When the white population shows up with 61%, and Hispanic only has 17%, there’s something not right about that.… There are currently no Hispanic elected officials in Ford County, and we’re 60% Hispanic, here.”Pando, the attorney, said the issue might be that newly naturalized citizens or the children of immigrants haven’t historically been encouraged to get involved. “You’re not raised in a household that teaches you to participate civically and to vote and to inform yourself,” Pando said, also citing past problems with a lack of bilingual signage in the city. “The voters here, especially Hispanic voters, don’t feel invited to partake.”The polling station Tuesday featured signs in English and Spanish, but it was less welcoming to journalists trying to monitor the situation: An attorney hired by the county forbade journalists on site from taking photos inside.It is typical for journalists to be allowed to take photographs inside polling stations. The Times took a photo before the attorney, Brad Schlozman, informed a reporter of the rule.But the decision to forbid photographs might not be as notable as the attorney passing along the order: Schlozman, a former Department of Justice attorney under the George W. Bush administration, received notoriety a decade ago for being the subject of an inspector general report accusing him of politicizing the department’s nonpartisan hiring process.“My tentative plans are to gerrymander all of those crazy libs right out of the section,” Schlozman wrote in one email released in the investigation. Ford County Clerk Debbie Cox, who manages polling stations in the county, later told reporters that she thought allowing media inside to document the Dodge City polling station would be “too disruptive” and that she would be releasing government-approved photos of the polling station later.Cox also received notoriety for an email recently when she forwarded a letter from the ACLU to the Kansas secretary of state’s office, run by Republican Kris Kobach, with the notation: “LOL.”","dateModified":"2018-11-06T23:31:33.617Z","datePublished":"2018-11-06T21:40:00.000Z","headline":"Buses, carpools stay idle in Dodge City as vote-suppression fears fail to materialize","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Matt Pearce"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#buses-carpools-stay-idle-in-dodge-city-as-vote-suppression-fears-fail-to-materialize"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageIt took only two minutes — maybe less — for 28-year-old Christian Martinez to drop off his vote-by-mail ballot at American Legion Post 335 in South Gate.“I dropped it off because I wanted to make sure they got it,” he said.Wearing a green jacket and black pants, Martinez said he voted mostly for Democratic Party candidates, because they fell in line with his beliefs.  He said President Trump and his Republican Party also played a factor in how he voted today.“I didn’t like the candidates,” he said. “I’m not gonna lie, everything that has been going on has played a part, not just ‘I don’t like Donald Trump,’ but more like all the people around him, all the people supporting him and everyone else saying we should do what he says, that’s the right thing to do. I disagree, so I chose not to vote on the Republican side. “Martinez and others like him will play a pivotal role in today’s election, particularly in key battleground states where the Latino vote could mean the difference between winning and losing.   Still, Martinez makes up a relatively small percentage of eligible Latino voters who cast ballots. Those numbers are lower during non-presidential elections.There are 29 million Latinos who are eligible to vote in this year’s midterm election, making up about 13% of all eligible voters in the United States. About 44% of Latinos who are eligible to vote are between the ages of 18 and 35.  But that’s also the same age group that has contributed to low turnout rates among Latino voters. Martinez said he began voting when he was 18. He said his parents vote, but his civic life began to take shape as he read and watched the news more often.  “I felt it was important,” he said. “Since an early age, I’ve been aware that if you’re not active in politics, you’re going to be affecting stuff and just by not voting, by not taking action, you’re allowing other people to take action and do things their way.”Farther down the street, Ricardo and Terry Avalos had just voted. The husband and wife said they hoped the election would send a blue Democratic wave washing across America.“Hopefully things will change for the better,” said Terry Avalos, 69.They said they voted to oppose President Trump, to save healthcare and to also help Democrats take control of the Congress.  “We need a voice,” Terry Avalos said. “We’ve had plenty of Republican presidents before and we had no issues, but this is bad.”Ricardo Avalos, 71, said he doesn’t like Trump and his rhetoric, but admits he has made some smart financial moves for the country by making sure other nations pay their fair share.The couple said they voted for Gavin Newsom as governor, but when it came to Proposition 10, the rent-control measure, they couldn’t agree on whether they voted the same.“We voted yes,” Ricardo Avalos said.“No,” Terry Avalos said at the same time.“Yes,” her husband responded. “We voted yes.”One thing they could agree on was that they had noticed younger people voting. More women too.“Usually it’s old people,”  Ricardo Avalos said.He said it was a positive thing to see.  He hopes that younger Latino men and women turn out to vote and they continue to do so in future elections.The couple said they were cautiously optimistic about how the election would turn out.“Last we saw with Hillary [Clinton] and Trump, we went to bed and she was winning. The next morning we woke up and learned she lost the election. It was like a funeral.”Perhaps no one sees a more grim view of election day than Maria Arriaga, 55.She said that even though she was a registered voter, work was going to prevent her from going to the polls.Inside the South Gate market she works at, the Huntington Park resident said she feels left out and guilty.“I know my vote matters,” she said. “I know it counts and it can help someone.”Arriaga said she didn’t know how to fill out a vote-by-mail ballot and didn’t know how to figure out who to ask.She said she did receive text messages about Propositions 8 and 10, and even got one from Ed Hernandez, who is running for lieutenant governor. She also received one in Spanish about the importance of voting.“I feel terrible,” she said, adding she wanted to vote against Republicans because of Trump.“It’s the way he’s spoken about women, how he said that woman had a ‘horse face,’ and Republicans have supported him throughout all the things he has done and said.”Arriaga was referring to Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who is in a legal dispute with Trump.Arriaga said this is the first election she has missed. She began voting in 1995 after she became a citizen. She said she has missed some midterm elections, but has shown up to cast a ballot in every presidential race.Not far from Arriaga’s workplace, Florentino Mata, 81, was walking home from his polling station. He said he voted for mostly Democratic candidates.“I have hope that they can help us, even if I don’t believe they can keep their promises,” he said. “But it’s some hope.”He said he wants Democrats to take back the House and Senate to prevent any more attacks on immigrants.Despite the streak of votes he gave to Democrats, he decided to lean toward Republican candidate for governor, John Cox, because he felt he was the better candidate. Mata said he took some advice from his daughter, too. “All you can do is wait for the results now.”","dateModified":"2018-11-06T21:55:48.972Z","datePublished":"2018-11-06T21:30:00.000Z","headline":"‘We need a voice’: Latino voters hope for surge in turnout","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e7e8477/2147483647/strip/true/crop/575x323+0+37/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F85%2F961c94d5bfedba20595d3aceb03f%2Fla-lb-media-avalos-20181106-123831","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#we-need-a-voice-latino-voters-hope-for-surge-in-turnout"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageRoughly three out of four likely voters in a Dornsife-L.A.

He said the person or group of people stole computers, cellphones and thousands of door hangers with candidate and polling information.“It is one those things that makes you believe that it was someone who came in under the auspices of being a volunteer,” Sanders said. “They sized the place up, knew where things were … knew exactly what they were doing.”The spokesman said the computers had voter information and walking maps. Volunteers had planned to pass out the campaign material Tuesday in the heated contest between Caballero and Republican Rob Poythress.Merced police said the total reported value of property taken is $24,000 and that they have no suspects yet.  ImageState Democrats’ super-majority status in the Legislature hinges on one state Senate seat this year, and Caballero’s race has become the year’s most expensive state legislative contest. She is running against Poythress, a Madera County supervisor, to replace state Sen. Anthony Cannella (R-Ceres) in the 12th District, stretching from Fresno to Monterey counties.Democratic campaign volunteers also have been making final pushes for Rep. Jim Costa (D-Fresno), who is facing off against Republican Elizabeth Heng in the 16th Congressional District, and for Democrat Josh Harder, who is locked in a virtual tie against Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Turlock) in the neighboring 10th Congressional District, spanning Stanislaus County and southern San Joaquin County.Campaign manager Ken Smith denounced the actions as the same kind of distortions and lies he said voters were seeing at a national level. “She knows voters can and will see this felony for what it is: a last desperate attempt to subvert not just the voters will, but our democracy itself,” he said of Caballero.2 p.m.: This post has been updated with additional comments from Caballero’s campaign manager and the Merced Police Department.This post was originally published at 1 p.m.","dateModified":"2018-11-06T22:12:42.435Z","datePublished":"2018-11-06T21:00:00.000Z","headline":"Caballero campaign reports break-in at downtown Merced office","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/007ef36/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1399x787+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F55%2F39%2F4476fcdd7a28ed65b22e45d3c282%2Fla-1540104129-puvnj9nxgq-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Jazmine Ulloa"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#caballero-campaign-reports-break-in-at-downtown-merced-office"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageAs polls opened across the country, residents of several states were contending with severe weather conditions that could affect voter turnout.A line of storms moved through the Deep South overnight and early Tuesday, knocking down trees and power lines from Louisiana to South Carolina.

Authorities notified the company about recently discovered online activity “they believe may be linked to foreign entities,” Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, wrote in the post. U.S. tech companies have stepped up their work against disinformation campaigns, aiming to stymie online troublemakers' efforts to divide voters and discredit democracy. Facebook's purge is part of countermeasures to prevent abuses like those used by Russian groups two years ago to sway public opinion ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The company based in Menlo Park, Calif., has been somewhat regularly disclosing such purges in recent months, most recently in October. More are likely going forward since, even as its systems get better at detecting and removing malicious accounts, the bad actors are sharpening their attacks too. Gleicher said Facebook will provide an update once it learns more, including whether the blocked accounts are linked to the Russia-based Internet Research Agency, or other foreign entities. Almost all of the Facebook pages associated with the blocked accounts appeared to be in French or Russian. The Instagram accounts were mostly in English and were focused either on celebrities or political debate. No further details were given about the accounts or suspicious activity. Last month, Facebook removed 82 pages, accounts and groups tied to Iran and aimed at stirring up strife in the U.S. and the U.K. It carried out an even broader sweep in August, removing 652 pages, groups and accounts linked to Russia and Iran. Twitter, meanwhile, has said it has identified more than 4,600 accounts and 10 million tweets, mostly affiliated with the Internet Research Agency, which was linked to foreign meddling in U.S. elections, including the presidential vote of 2016. The agency, a Russian troll farm, has been indicted by U.S. special counsel Robert S. Mueller III for its actions during the 2016 vote. Facebook, Twitter and other companies have been fighting misinformation and election meddling on their services for the past two years. There are signs they're making headway, although they're still a very long way from winning the war. Facebook, in particular, has reversed its stance of late 2016, when CEO Mark Zuckerberg dismissed as “pretty crazy” the notion that fake news on his service could have swayed the presidential election. In July, for instance, the company said that its spending on security and content moderation, coupled with other business shifts, would hinder its growth and profitability. Investors expressed their displeasure by knocking $119 billion off Facebook's market value. One problem is that it's not just agents from Russia and other nations who are intent on sharing misinformation and propaganda. There is plenty of homegrown fake news too, whether in the U.S. or elsewhere. Still, Facebook is seeing some payoff, and not just with the accounts it has been able to find and take down. A recent research collaboration between New York University and Stanford found that user “interactions” with fake news stories on Facebook, which rose substantially in 2016 during the presidential campaign, fell significantly between the end of 2016 and July 2018. On Twitter, however, the sharing of such stories continued to rise over the last two years.  ","dateModified":"2018-11-06T20:26:26.963Z","datePublished":"2018-11-06T20:08:00.000Z","headline":"Facebook blocks 115 accounts ahead of U.S. midterm elections","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a5082b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff6%2F94%2Fee36c4be9d3d849100201cc6987b%2Fimg-5af5e8a2-turbine-la-1526065310-fm17842gb6-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Associated Press"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#facebook-blocks-115-accounts-ahead-of-u-s-midterm-elections"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageKatie Hill, the Democrat who is challenging Republican incumbent Steve Knight in California’s 25th Congressional District,  casts her ballot under the watchful eye of the media at Shepherd of the Hills Church in Agua Dulce. More visual coverage: America goes to the polls","dateModified":"2018-11-07T00:03:23.475Z","datePublished":"2018-11-06T20:06:00.000Z","headline":"Cameras are rolling: Katie Hill casts her ballot in the 25th Congressional District","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fd09459/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F68%2Fd0%2F0147de07af2ef04e07e12eba6009%2Fla-lb-media-3064008-la-pol-katie-hill-voting-01fo-20181106-114609","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Francine Orr"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#cameras-are-rolling-katie-hill-casts-her-ballot-in-the-25th-congressional-district"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe shouts of children playing soccer in a nearby school yard echoed across the polling station, but Brian Kim kept his focus glued to the ballot guide in his hand.The 36-year-old Newport Beach resident said he had a friend who was gravely ill and undergoing dialysis, so this election — and Proposition 8 specifically — were very important to him. \"Politics usually doesn't come up in my circles,” said Kim, who runs a property management business. “Yet when something affects someone you know, it changes the game.\"Kim said he supported the measure, which seeks to cap profits for large dialysis companies.

And of those, about 42% are permanent vote-by-mail voters.Let’s use the June primary election as an example:When 100% of the precincts were counted by about 4 a.m. on June 6, voter turnout in L.A. County hovered around 18.6%. Of the 952,633 ballots that were counted, about 30% were vote-by-mail ballots.By the time the canvassing had been completed more than three weeks later, vote-by-mail ballots accounted for 44.6% of the total ballots cast and turnout came in at a still-underwhelming 29%.You can get live updates on the current results here.The county will continue to count ballots throughout the month, ending with the county Board of Supervisors certifying the vote in early December.

He was in no rush to cast his ballot at Gonzalez Park, one of many polling places in Compton.“I voted a long time ago,” he said.Thomas sent in his absentee ballot weeks ago. Today he was here to just get coffee.“Then I’m off to work,” he said with a chuckle.Thomas has been voting since he was 18 and has never missed an election, especially one where he has the opportunity to tilt some power back to Democrats.“They have to get back into power,” he said.Why? Simple, President Trump.“I just don’t understand this president,” he said.But voting for his party doesn’t mean he thinks it’s good. In the end, he said both parties needed to come together and stop bickering.Thomas would not say who he voted for in the governor’s race but said one issue he felt was important was Proposition 10.The problem was, he thinks he may have messed up his vote. He wanted to vote for more rent control but said he voted against the proposition.Proposition 10 would repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, a 1995 law that restricted cities’ ability to enact or expand rent control. Costa-Hawkins bars cities from imposing rent control on apartments built after 1995 (or earlier in cities that already had rent control in place), forbids rent control on single-family homes and condominiums, and prohibits “vacancy control,” which is when a unit’s rent stays capped even after the tenant moves out. Under Costa-Hawkins, Los Angeles cannot impose rent control on apartments built after 1978, when the city’s rent stabilization ordinance was adopted.“It was confusing,” Thomas said. “I kept hearing no, no, so I voted the way I did.”","dateModified":"2018-11-06T17:50:06.685Z","datePublished":"2018-11-06T17:42:00.000Z","headline":"In Compton, election day is a time of confusion","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-2018-htmlstory.html#in-compton-election-day-is-a-time-of-confusion"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe 2018 midterm elections have consumed and convulsed the nation like few nonpresidential elections have in recent times.Voters on Tuesday will pour into polling places across the country in elections that give Democrats their first opportunity to claw back into power in the Trump era.In order to provide the broadest possible access to information, the Los Angeles Times has lifted its online paywall for stories about the elections.Here is The Times' developing coverage from Tuesday:Live updates as we track major U.S. House, Senate and gubernatorial races in California and across the countryWhere California candidates for governor John Cox and Gavin Newsom stand on top issuesA look at the most likely outcomes of the next Congress5 things to watch for in California's tight congressional racesWill California flip the House?

Adam B. Schiff and a call for women to transform Congress. A crowd of mostly women gathered in the House candidate’s Santa Clarita headquarters and listened as Schiff (D-Burbank) helped pump up the canvassers who were preparing to spread out across California's 25th Congressional District.\"Women are going to transform the Congress, so much for the better,” Schiff said, then referred to the recent confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. “If half of the members of Congress were women, we wouldn't leave a credible allegation of sexual assault to be investigated in a matter of hours or days. We would take that seriously. We wouldn't stand a president mocking the victim of assault if there were a few more women in the Congress of the United States.\"Hill is challenging two-term incumbent Rep. Steve Knight (R-Palmdale) in one of the most hotly contested House races in the state. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won the district by almost seven points, making it a top pickup opportunity for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Despite the loyalty Knight engenders from a district that sent him back to Congress with 53% of the vote in 2016, Hill's supporters are confident. As of Monday night, Knight's official Wikipedia page had been modified to say he served in Congress from 2015 to 2019 and was succeeded by Katie Hill.  ImageHill got assists from Schiff and Sandra Fluke, an L.A.-based lawyer and women's rights activist who came to fame when conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh called her names and questioned her character after she testified in favor of requiring health insurance plans to cover contraceptives in 2012. Fluke herself made a run for office in 2014, but lost her bid for a California State Senate seat. Her own experiences on the campaign trail gave her a new appreciation for women who can stand up for themselves, she told the audience, praising Hill as someone who has been fighting for the vulnerable for much of her career. \"We know she's too strong to be silenced, we know she is strong enough to fight for our community, and we know she's strong enough to fight for our values,\" Fluke said. ","dateModified":"2018-11-06T15:27:02.940Z","datePublished":"2018-11-06T05:53:27.000Z","headline":"Rallying Katie Hill’s canvassers, Rep.

She and Democrat Gil Cisneros, who has also been reaching out to Asian voters, are in a close race to replace Kim’s former boss Rep.

Korean Americans make up an estimated 4% of registered voters here.On a Monday afternoon, few residents were home; doors with rows of shoes neatly stacked outside stayed shut.Shane Huh drove up her driveway as Kim came knocking. When she and her husband got out of their car, Kim urged them to vote and gave them the address of their polling place. As Kim left, Huh thrust up her arms in a show of strength. “You must win!” she said in Korean. TweetDown the block, Sun Bok Kim paused her piano playing to answer the door and tell Kim that she’d already mailed her ballot. “I’m praying for you!” she called out as Kim walked away.Heading to a Korean market and food court a short distance away, Kim stopped to shake hands and greet customers, many of whom recognized her. “Annyeonghaseyo!” — “Hello!” she said to each of them. Bong Soo Lee stood behind a counter selling vitamins and said he’d already cast a ballot for her.

Jeff Denham (R-Turlock). They also cast the race as a fight for the state’s future  — and against the San Francisco values that they said Newsom and Harder represent. Harder, 32, and Denham, 51, are running in a tight race targeted by national Democrats in efforts to flip the House.Speaking to reporters afterward, Newsom looked bleary-eyed and weary but confident. When a reporter asked what his first move as governor would be, he laughed and said, “That is a real question now because this could happen in a couple hours.”Newsom said he made his final stop in the Central Valley because he remained committed to bridging the urban-rural divide and believed Harder, who was born and raised in the district and has a background in tech, was the candidate who could help do that.Newsom also sought to assuage residents’ concerns over water, calling himself a farmer deeply rooted to farmer’s anxieties over water and the seasons.“I made that commitment that I am going to be a governor not just for the Bay Area, not just Northern California but the Central Valley, Southern California,” he said. “I don’t want to be a meme.

Mimi Walters (R-Irvine) went knocking on doors Monday afternoon, it was all enthusiastic supporters who greeted her.Using a voter information app, Walters was focusing her eleventh-hour efforts on getting likely supporters to the polls. “We’ve got, let’s see…” Ray Martin, 65, said, going through the adults living in the house. “We’ve got five, you’ve got five.” “Great, I’ve got five votes out of this house,” Walters said, pumping her fist.“Good luck. We’ve got to keep it going,” Martin said.  ImageMartin said he agreed with Walters’ principles of less government regulation, lower taxes and financial accountability. He said he wanted the Republicans to maintain control of the house so they could continue the agenda he voted for in 2016 — President Trump’s agenda.“Strong economy, a common-sense government, America first, strong borders, law and order,” he said, adding that he was puzzled by the opposition. “Feels like we’ve got something going. Why wouldn’t everyone want the country to prosper? Resist for what?”Walters said she believed the race was close only because of the millions of dollars poured into the district by the national Democratic Party.The policies of her challenger, UC Irvine law professor Katie Porter, “do not reflect what this community is all about,” she said.Asked how often Trump comes up in her conversation with voters, Walters said, “Not really that often.”A few doors down from Martin, 40-year-old Jackie Clinton also excitedly told Walters that she had her and her husband’s vote. ImageLater, Clinton told a reporter she had to keep her voice down — they had a volunteer for the Porter campaign who had been renting an upstairs room for the last two months.Clinton, a database engineer, said they had avoided talking about their political leanings, although the volunteer may have very well guessed it from the number of firearms in the house. She said she felt strongly about fiscal responsibility and the 2nd Amendment.“We can’t lose control of the House. We’re barely hanging on by the skin of our teeth,” she said.In a sign of shifting demographics in the traditional Republican stronghold, which has never sent a Democrat to Congress, at least a third of the voters who came to the door were Asian Americans.One Asian American man told Walters that 10 of his friends had all gotten together the night before and voted for Republicans across the board.“You’re Republican, right? I love it,” he said. “We all vote for Republicans. … You’re the right one.”","dateModified":"2018-11-06T16:03:26.851Z","datePublished":"2018-11-06T02:42:00.000Z","headline":"Eager supporters greet Rep.

Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) spent Monday afternoon stumping with Democrat Gil Cisneros, who’s locked in a tight battle with Republican Young Kim to replace her former boss Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton).Schiff, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said he was feeling optimistic about Democrats’ chances of netting the 23 seats they need to take back control of the House. If they succeed, Schiff is widely expected to take over as chair of the committee tasked with investigating Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election.“We’re not taking anything for granted,” Schiff said, but laid out his priorities as the committee’s chair if control of the House flips. Reviving the investigation into Russia’s election meddling is at the top of the list, Schiff said, and also probing whether Russia has financial leverage over President Trump through his business interests.“The president has sought to keep that off limits, but if that’s the leverage Russians pose that’s a real threat to our country,” Schiff told The Times.The Republican-led committee ended its investigation into Russian meddling by saying no evidence was found of conspiracy between Trump’s team and Russians. Democrats said the majority had only conducted a superficial probe.Another priority would be repairing the rift between Congress and the intelligence community, which he blamed on the release of a controversial memo by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Tulare). The memo made allegations that the FBI did improper surveillance of a former Trump campaign advisor during the 2016 election, a charge Democrats and the FBI have denied.On stage, Schiff laid out the stakes of the election for several dozen volunteers gathered to knock on doors.“It is not just that we have a deeply unethical man in the Oval Office,” Schiff said. “What has our Republic trembling right now is that he has a Congress that is deeply complicit in what he is doing...That changes tomorrow.”Times staff writer Chris Megerian contributed to this report.","dateModified":"2018-11-06T07:07:35.580Z","datePublished":"2018-11-05T22:24:41.000Z","headline":"Rep.

Devin Nunes is beloved by his supporters in this rural Central Valley district where GOP registered voters safely outnumber Democrats. But that hasn’t stopped 71-year-old Patty Lennon from working to unseat him over the last year.The retired kindergarten teacher on Monday was one of dozens of volunteers helping to coordinate and train canvassers making a final push for Democrat Andrew Janz. Like many Janz supporters there, she said Nunes had lost his way and is playing into President Trump’s hands at the expense of his constituents.“I don’t see it as a Republican or Democrat thing,” she said, decked in a yellow traffic vest and jeans. “I see it as doing what is best for the Valley. People thought we needed a change in 2016, and I think we need that change for seat 22.”Janz, a 34-year-old Fresno County prosecutor, decided to challenge Nunes after the election of Trump. He poses the most serious competition Nunes, an eight-term incumbent and highest-ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, has faced in years. But the odds against Janz are so high that national Democrats chose not to fund him in the solidly Republican 22nd Congressional District. TweetSpanning the more conservative parts of Fresno and Tulare counties, the district has a voter registration advantage of nine percentage points over Democrats and Trump beat Hillary Clinton here by nearly 10 points. Nunes, 45, defeated his last Democratic opponent by roughly 35 points. He has spent much of his political career focused on water storage and irrigation. But he’s faced scrutiny in the last year over his actions to protect Trump from the Russia investigation, his family’s out-of-state dairy farm and what critics call his lack of responsiveness to constituents. Janz’s supporters are optimistic that Nunes has lost enough ground that the Democrat has a chance. TweetJanz’s campaign office in a North Fresno shopping center was buzzing. Lennon said she felt hopeful and teared up at the prospect of his victory amid a year of hurtful rhetoric from Trump, immigrant children in cages and deadly violence at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Even if Janz lost, she said, she would remain positive.“We are building a foundation to move forward,” she said. “If it is not this time, it will be next time.”Nearby, Daniel Schwartz, 57, was preparing to knock on doors. He came to volunteer for the first time, frustrated by what he called a false narrative from Nunes that Janz supporters are “communist radicals” and “San Francisco liberals.”“People in the community need to realize that we are other people like them,” the Fresno landlord said. “We are their neighbors.”","dateModified":"2018-11-05T21:46:51.001Z","datePublished":"2018-11-05T21:31:00.000Z","headline":"‘We are building a foundation’: Democrat Andrew Janz’s supporters hopeful for a win against  Rep.

It has to be this generation,\" said David Hogg, one of the Parkland, Fla., student survivors-turned-activists. Hogg was followed on stage by three Orange County students who are running for local city councils in San Clemente and Mission Viejo.Jackson Hinkle, a 19-year-old candidate for San Clemente City Council, said issues like gun violence and the environment made the election pressing for young voters. “We’re fighting for the existence of our generation,\" he said.In the audience were fellow young people flying in the face of the stereotype that young people aren't engaged.Carly Shaffer, 18, had driven up from San Marcos in northern San Diego County with her mother and sister. Shaffer had spent the morning canvassing as she has been most weekends. During the primaries, when she voted for the first time in her life, she showed up so early she was first in line at her precinct. “I realized my voice wasn’t going to be heard unless I made it heard,\" said Shaffer, who organized three walk-outs at her school as part of a nationwide campaign against gun violence, as she chowed down on popcorn. She said she would not have been nearly as active had Hillary Clinton won the presidency.UC Irvine freshman Serena Torres said she definitely planned on voting on Nov. 6. It's her birthday, and she'll be turning 18.Torres said her mother, a judge who is politically active, had drilled in her the importance of voting because of all those who fought for women to have the right to vote.

Dana Rohrabacher treated his supporters to burgers with a side of gratitude at a volunteer appreciation event Sunday night.The 71-year-old congressman mingled with almost 50 volunteers and fellow Republican politicians in the parking lot of his headquarters in Costa Mesa, in California’s 48th Congressional District.Children tore through the parking lot while In-N-Out employees shouted order numbers from inside their truck.In brief remarks at his only campaign event of the weekend open to the news media, Rohrabacher cast the midterm elections as a battle between billionaires seeking to influence regional politics and local patriots.\"These people are trying control this election with their billions of dollars and try to undercut this president,\" he said. \"I can tell you today we the people are behind the president.\" VideoThe 15-term incumbent is facing a tough challenge from Democrat Harley Rouda, whose campaign has outraised Rohrabacher’s by almost $5 million this cycle. A political committee backed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is spending $4 million on ads opposing Rohrabacher.The hotly contested race is one of at least seven in California that could help determine whether Democrats are able to flip control of the House. In a tweet that appeared within two hours of Rohrabacher’s event ending, President Trump pointed out the “vast sums” Democrats were spending. Trump also praised Rohrabacher as a congressman who works hard and produces for his district.Fred Whitaker, chairman of the Republican Party of Orange County, said a combination of Republican experience and effort should be enough to stave off the challenge.\"We've been running races for a long time,\" he said.Rohrabacher has faced criticism over his friendliness with people connected with Russia’s government. And his disregard of the scientific consensus that human activity is driving climate change has brought him attention nationally. But local supporters highlighted Rohrabacher’s accessibility and attention to local issues.Mehrdad Sharif, 50, an anesthesiologist who lives in Laguna Niguel, said he supported Rohrabacher because of what he described as \"incremental policies\" that helped both the district and the country.\"He's always out and about in the community, always having events,\" said David Taylor. The Irvine native gestured at the lawmaker, who was working his way through the crowd with handshakes and photos. \"Look, he's taking a picture right now. It doesn't get more responsive than this. You can just go right up to him and talk to him.\"Assemblyman Matthew Harper (R-Huntington Beach), whose district overlaps with the 48th, said he was there to show party solidarity.\"Unified Republicans, especially here in coastal Orange County, win when we stick together,\" he said. \"Congressman Rohrabacher is someone who we've always been able to count on ... he's a very principled conservative, and he very much reflects this coastal Orange County area.\"Harper and his staff have been putting in 12-hour days, he estimated, as they seek to fight off a well-funded Democratic challenger of their own.In rejoining Rohrabacher’s reelection efforts, Harper brought his political career full circle: The Huntington Beach native recalled volunteering for Rohrabacher in 1988, when he was a student at Huntington Beach High School.Read more about the 48th District candidates’ stances on the issues. ","dateModified":"2018-11-05T19:41:42.518Z","datePublished":"2018-11-05T14:30:00.000Z","headline":"Rep.
