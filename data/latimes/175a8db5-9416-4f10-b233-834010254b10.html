My senior year, a close friend showed me Jonathan Gold&#39;s work. His reviews not only introduced me to some of the best food I have ever eaten, but also forced me to explore and learn about the city that has been my home ever since I graduated. He was fundamental in my appreciation of this city and I will greatly miss his unique voice and exceptional recommendations." data-photo="">

He had a transcendental experience with dilis. He dropped his iPhone between the thin space of the wall and the booth and I had to retrieve it as gracefully as possible using kitchen tongs, while suffering an acute panic attack. He also snapped a picture of his adobo rice bowl and posted it on Instagram. “Things in a bowl” it was captioned. The post was live for less than two hours, but by the time dinner service had rolled around a small crowd had gathered at our door. Gold would visit a handful more times before writing us a lovely review in 2017. He also included us in his round up 10 best things he ate in 2017 and snuck us into his 101 list at number 90. While J.Gold&#39;s recognition was certainly not the end of our restaurant troubles, his recognition gave us the boost of moral we needed to press on that first year. .... He championed for Filipino food (for immigrant food, really) in a way that reminded us why we started all this to begin with. Southern California&#39;s culinary landscape will not be the same with out him." data-photo="">

A cup of coffee and the Saturday section are my favorite ways to start the day. I have read and enjoyed his columns from his beginnings with The Times, and Saturday mornings with not be the same. My heart goes out to his family and friends -- he will surely be missed by many.
