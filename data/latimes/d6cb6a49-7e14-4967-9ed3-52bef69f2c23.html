Forecasters predicted about an inch of precipitation, saying the relatively weak system would sputter out by early Wednesday.But a stronger storm will roll in late Wednesday, bringing with it the potential for debris flows and up to 3 inches of rain through Thursday night.The Butte County Emergency Operations Center has prepared for the rain by clearing drainage culverts of debris, said Matt Gates, public information officer for the Paradise Police Department.The California Conservation Corps also has been working on erosion-control measures for mountain slopes filled with fire-damaged pine and chaparral.“Ash doesn’t absorb water, which complicates things,” Gates said.A third storm could bring 2½ to 4 inches of rain to the charred region from Friday through Sunday.“It’s the intensity that can cause debris flows,” said Eric Kurth, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “If the rain comes over time, there’s some opportunity for it to absorb or gradually run off. When we have rapid runoff, that’s when it can bring down entire hillsides.”The soil in recently burned areas cannot absorb significant amounts of rainwater, so excessive precipitation can lead to fast-moving flows containing mud, debris and even trees and boulders. The devastation can be deadly and often comes without warning.The rain is also expected to complicate the already challenging search for human remains among the rubble of the Camp fire.Typically, crews scoop fire debris into a screen and sift it, looking for bone or bone fragments, but the ash and rain have mixed to form a clay-like substance, making the task nearly impossible. Officials have had to bring in water and gently wash away the clay to expose potential human remains in the charred mess.","dateModified":"2018-11-28T01:58:44.794Z","datePublished":"2018-11-28T01:47:00.000Z","headline":"New storms bring fresh anxiety in Paradise","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Hannah Fry"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#new-storms-bring-fresh-anxiety-in-paradise"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageButte County Sheriff Kory Honea on Monday released the names of 16 more people who died in the Camp fire. The death toll from California’s worst fire jumped to 88, with 203 people still missing, officials said.Authorities released the the latest of names after notifying the victims’ next of kin.According to the Sheriff’s Office, they are: Joyce Acheson, 78, of Paradise.  Carol Arrington, 88, of Paradise.

Unable to find single-family homes in the area, evacuees have resorted to renting individual bedrooms, buying recreational vehicles and purchasing travel trailers.

But that number has been dropping in recent days. Over the weekend, it declined from more than 400 to 249 as officials were able to confirm more people on the list were actually alive.Several days of rain last week helped firefighters get a handle on the fire.Authorities expect the removal of ash and other toxic debris from the fire will be the largest such effort ever undertaken by state officials.The amount of debris is expected to dwarf the cleanup effort undertaken from last year's Northern California fires. That effort led to more than 2 million tons of toxic debris removed from 6,000 properties in seven California counties: Sonoma, Napa, Lake, Mendocino, Butte, Yuba and Nevada, said Eric Lamoureux of the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services.County, state and federal governments jump start the process of removal of toxic ash and other debris, and can do so at no cost to the owner, Lamoureux said.

When she stumbles upon this display of normalcy, she can barely hold it together.“It’s hard to think about the holidays right now,” she said as she sat at a table in the Chico Mall food court, where she and her husband were discussing their options with a home insurance company representative. “I don’t have a home to put a tree in right now.”Gray and her husband, Scott, lived in their Paradise home on Oak Way for 20 years. What she will miss the most are the pine trees in her backyard and the cool shade they provided, a simple pleasure she could count on even when the mercury hit 100.At 10 a.m. on the day of the fire, Gray’s 19-year-old son, Dylan, came running down the street. He had gotten stuck in gridlock traffic on Wagstaff Road, and seeing the plumes of black smoke ahead of him, he ditched his car in the closest parking lot and darted home, the only one he’s ever known. “There’s a fire, we gotta get out,” he shouted. They had not received an evacuation alert.Gray did not think the house would burn. They lived a block from a fire station. Before leaving, she touched a redwood keepsake box that contained her children’s first teeth. “If I take this to a shelter, it could get stolen,” she thought. She left it.The family also left three dogs behind, taking several others with them in separate cars. Gray’s thinking was this: if there was looting, the big dogs would protect the home. Gray found the animals’ remains when she returned to Paradise last week. She is consumed by guilt.Gray and her family -- four adults and two kids -- are staying in an RV as they search for a rental. Her 29-year-old daughter, Shannon, also lost her home in Magalia.“I feel lost. I just feel so homesick and I can’t seem to get past that yet,” Gray said, tearing up. “It’s hard for me to think about where I want to be in the future.\"Just as she was being asked what she was grateful for on the eve of Thanksgiving, Gray’s teenage daughter, Victoria, bounded up to her in the food court with several shopping bags in her hand.“I got you shoes,” Victoria said, pulling out a pair of gray Champion slip-ons. “They were on sale.”Gray tugged off one of the brown Ugg boots she got at a shelter. She tried on a sneaker.“I’m grateful that my family made it out alive,” Gray said, returning to the question. “It’s easy to answer that when it’s staring me right in the face. It’s when I’m alone that I go into a dark place.”","dateModified":"2018-11-22T20:43:49.906Z","datePublished":"2018-11-22T19:47:00.000Z","headline":"She lost her home and dogs in the Paradise fire.

A two-bedroom mobile home with a birdbath out front on Skyway road where deer and bobcats roamed.It is likely gone, they think, because they have seen a map of the burn area — a cloud of red over where they lived for four years.Steve Weathington, 67, and his girlfriend, Irene Schwab, 65, now lay their heads on green cots in an exhibit hall at the Yuba-Sutter Fairgrounds. Their possessions are few, but they made it out with their two trucks, two dogs and two cats. A fortune, they know, compared with what others escaped with.The morning the fire broke out, the couple had sat down to waffles and eggs when they noticed the sky was a smoky orange. Schwab went outside to settle a patio umbrella that was thrashing in the wind. A manager of their mobile home park had begun driving around, honking.Grabbing clothes, toiletries, medicine and the animals, Weathington hopped into his truck. Schwab followed behind in hers.“It was burning on both sides of the road,” Schwab recalled. “You could feel the heat from the flames.” It took them more than three hours to get to Chico, usually a 25-minute drive.They are grateful to be alive, to have had insurance on their home, to be capable and willing to start somewhere new. They may stay and find a place in Yuba City, a community they’ve grown to appreciate. When they venture out of the shelter, an act of kindness is usually bestowed upon them. Waitresses have bought them dinner, a barber refused money for a haircut. They have picked out clothes for free and marveled over the donations that file in daily.“We get a little teary-eyed because it’s really emotional,” said Weathington, a retired commercial painter and U.S. Marines veteran, his eyes growing red.Still, the timing of everything is hard to take. The couple used to host Thanksgiving dinner for family with a spread of traditional fare, including pumpkin cheesecake and homemade biscuits. The holiday rings a bit hollow now, eliciting memories of what they once had.","dateModified":"2018-11-22T18:08:47.529Z","datePublished":"2018-11-22T17:44:00.000Z","headline":"‘You could feel the heat from the flames’: Paradise survivor describes horror, survival","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#you-could-feel-the-heat-from-the-flames-paradise-survivor-describes-horror-survival"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Firefighters continued to make progress with California’s deadliest fire, with containment rising to 90% but with number of homes burned now at nearly 14,000.At least 83 people were killed when the fire swept into Paradise two weeks ago, and hundreds are still missing,Rain helped firefighters, but the weather has made the search for victims more difficult.“Precipitation has minimized fire activity and all fire lines continue to hold.

In a letter to founder Dakota Semler, Michaels said that despite the Woolsey fire’s passing, the giraffe remains in danger as long as it is in on their property.Celebrities and tourists have visited Saddlerock Ranch’s safari attraction for years to drink wine and snap selfies with the lone giraffe. But after the Woolsey fire, they used their clout to draw attention to the animal’s safety as the Woolsey fire roared toward the property.They and hundreds of nearby residents, strangers and animal lovers believed Stanley had been abandoned when Malibu Wine Safaris staff evacuated.A photo of the exotic animal on an open field with flames in the distance circulated on social media. Despite multiple statements made by the company, some people remained dubious. Due to the short notice given to area residents, the animals were not evacuated; instead, they were placed in an open dirt field that did not have much fuel to burn.“Stanley is doing fine,” said Bob Dunn after the fire passed through. Dunn, a close family friend who has helped care for the giraffe since its birth, said Stanley was “completely safe. He’s healthy.”Although many have moved on, Michaels isn’t satisfied.“Like millions of others, I saw and cannot shake off the picture of Stanley that showed flames approaching behind him, and I urge you not to keep him in the same path of danger,” Michaels wrote. “But fire or no fire, he needs to be moved to a place where he can thrive and he’s not just waiting for the monotony of his life to be broken when someone offers him a treat.”Michaels is backed by the animal rights group PETA, which has been working to identify alternate homes for the animals, should the Semlers comply with Michaels’ request.“Giraffes' special needs simply cannot be met at a roadside zoo like this,” Michaels said in the letter, “and if he hasn't already, he will soon begin to exhibit neurotic behavior resulting from captivity-related stress, frustration, and privation.”Rebecca Smudzinski, a wildlife specialist with PETA, said young male giraffes like Stanley often travel in “bachelor herds” and roam large savannas. One in captivity is likely to display signs of stress, such as repetitive licking and pacing.“The Woolsey fire exposed Stanley's sad, lonely life in that barren enclosure,” she said. “He's got nowhere to go and nothing to do, and so he just waits for people to feed him.”Organizations housing exotic animals are required to have a permit from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which follows minimal standards set by the Animal Welfare Act. The permit includes an annual inspection visit to ensure the animal is taken care of properly. But that isn’t enough, Smudzinski maintained. PETA wants the animal to be moved somewhere accredited by the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries or the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, which both require disaster plans to be reviewed and practiced regularly, she said.Michaels referenced Safari West in a Twitter post as an example of an organization that successfully saved exotic animals. Nancy Lang, co-owner of Safari West, said the organization was accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The staff there meet annually with law enforcement, the Humane Society and others to discuss disaster plans and practice regular drills, and partner with organizations that offer their facilities in case of emergencies. When the Tubbs fire approached their property in 2017, they had little time to react, making an evacuation impossible. Lang said whether Malibu Wine Safaris did the right thing is impossible to say without knowing their circumstance. Some of Safari West’s animals were also placed in an open field with little fuel to burn. It’s unclear what disaster plan Malibu Wine Safaris had in place, but its staff only had a couple of hours to act. Malibu Wine Safaris did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

The model also considers slope steepness, topography and fire severity. The dark red portions of the map indicate between an 80 and 100% chance of debris flows if rain reaches the assigned threshold for the map. Most areas affected by the Camp fire are colored yellow, indicating a 20% chance or less of debris flow. The Woolsey fire area on the other hand is mostly colored orange and red. The reason for the higher probability, Staley said, is that areas affected by the Woolsey fire are steeper than where the Camp fire burned.   ImageHowever, weather experts say rainfall in Southern California likely won’t be intense enough for dangerous mud flows. Rich Thomas, with the National Weather Service, said there will only be about quarter to three quarters of an inch of rainfall total. There’s only a 10 to 20% chance the rain will become heavy enough to create mudflows, he said.  ”There could be some minor debris flows, but nothing significant,” he said. “Rocks over the roadway, stuff like that.”Still, Thompson said people should be prepared and pay attention to local authorities for evacuation orders. To the west, the area affected by the Mendocino Complex fire appears to be at higher risk, Staley said. In August, the Mendocino Complex fire consumed more than 450,000 acres, becoming the largest wildfire in state history. The area’s steep terrain made it a challenge to firefighters and also increases the likelihood of mud flows.Heavy rain is expected this Thanksgiving holiday and debris flows will be a particular threat in the areas affected by the Camp, Carr, Delta, Hirz and Mendocino Complex fires, the NWS said.","dateModified":"2018-11-21T20:35:36.890Z","datePublished":"2018-11-21T19:36:00.000Z","headline":"Assessing the risk of mudslides in Malibu after California fires","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/739370c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1125x633+0+213/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F05%2Fb8%2Fa80affc1f0c5cfea75a9de506b49%2Fla-lb-media-camp-mudslide-20181121-122551","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Alejandra Reyes-Velarde"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#assessing-the-risk-of-mudslides-in-malibu-after-california-fires"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe first rain to fall over the burn-scarred areas of the Woolsey fire is expected to start Wednesday night.

Marcelo Quintero said.The property didn’t notify authorities about the bones until Saturday.Quintero said the skull was likely hidden by heavy brush in the area before the Woolsey fire, which scorched much of the land and several structures in the canyon above Malibu.Investigators believe the wildfire may have dislodged the remains from where they were stuck higher up the hilly terrain, and sent them tumbling down into the pathway where they were found, on property owned by the Ava and Cole Weintraub Family Park conservancy group.“The skull was broken into pieces but we were able to piece it somewhat together,” Quintero said. “The anthropologists at the coroner’s office believe it definitely predated the fire.”Coroner’s investigators believe the remains could been there between six months and 50 years, he said. They have some fire damage, he said, but no bite marks.“We only have parts of a skull, parts of a jaw and possibly some cervical vertebra pieces,” Quintero said.The Los Angeles County coroner’s Special Operations Response Team, or SORT, combed the area, hoping to find more remains. They did find additional bones, Quintero said, but they turned out to belong to animals.“We’re going to do our best to try to identify whoever this person was,” he said. “But it’s going to be a long shot, at best.”Anyone with information should contact the sheriff’s Homicide Bureau at (323) 890-5500. Those wishing to remain anonymous should call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477. ","dateModified":"2018-11-21T15:42:43.586Z","datePublished":"2018-11-21T15:10:00.000Z","headline":"Remains found above Malibu are not those of a Woolsey fire victim, but from earlier death, officials say","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Jeanette Marantos"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#remains-found-above-malibu-are-not-those-of-a-woolsey-fire-victim-but-from-earlier-death-officials-say"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageFirefighters are hoping to have full containment of the Woolsey fire sometime today.The fire, which killed three people, destroyed more than 1,600 structures and burned over 96,000 acres from Oak Park to Malibu, was 98% contained as of Tuesday night.People continued to return to their homes, but officials warned of possible rain in the burn areas later this week.","dateModified":"2018-11-21T15:10:20.154Z","datePublished":"2018-11-21T15:03:00.000Z","headline":"Woolsey fire expected to be fully contained today","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/10cd00e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1432x806+0+100/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fae%2F0d%2Fd320cd923cde6ace07652fbe7742%2Fla-lb-media-screenshot2018-11-14at85509pm-20181121-070255","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#woolsey-fire-expected-to-be-fully-contained-today"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"A pair of incoming storms are threatening to hamper recovery efforts in Paradise, Calif.In a worst-case scenario, the downpour could flood the ruins and wash away human remains, leaving authorities unable to find and identify every victim of California’s deadliest wildfire on record.Authorities fear bones could sink underwater, making them harder to spot and drowning any scent that cadaver dogs rely on to find them.Meteorologists say the Camp fire burn scar — which is larger than the city of San Jose — could see up to 6 inches of rain through Saturday, with the heaviest downpour expected overnight Thursday.

She said she registered with FEMA and hopes she’ll be able to get housing.“I don’t know what I’m going to do,” she said. “I told the manager of the Red Cross: ‘When you leave, I’m going with you.’”Perhaps her greatest worry is her son, Shawn Evans, 40, whom she last heard from while he was evacuating from Magalia. She said he was driving on Imperial Way with his wife, who is eight months pregnant.“I know where my husband is but I don’t know here my son is,” she said with teary eyes. “Please don’t tell me he died. Please.”She said she is clinging to hope that her son is OK and that they’ll be reunited soon. She said she’s afraid about the storm that is approaching the region. She’s afraid because she knows there’s still people who are missing, people who may have died in the fire.“I’m scared,” she said. “I’m scared they’ll be washed away and people’s remains will never be found.”Sitting across was Anthony Salzarulo, 60, who had fought to save his home and five others in Concow.

Nearly 80 are confirmed dead, but nearly 700 remain missing in the worst fire in California history.","dateModified":"2018-11-21T00:25:49.636Z","datePublished":"2018-11-20T23:50:00.000Z","headline":"California fires: Heavy rains could wash away human remains in Paradise, searchers fear","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8fb7328/2147483647/strip/true/crop/615x346+7+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F36%2F55%2F11ac4013ed26764d4287c355b579%2Fla-lb-media-campfire-20181120-154925","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#california-fires-heavy-rains-could-wash-away-human-remains-in-paradise-searchers-fear"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageVictims of the Woolsey fire have filed a lawsuit against Southern California Edison alleging the utility was negligent in failing to shut off power before the wildfire started, attorneys announced Tuesday. The lawsuit, filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court on behalf of 17 plaintiffs, alleges the company ignored warnings of extreme fire weather and only shut power off once the fire started. That delay contributed to the Woolsey fire’s destruction, plaintiffs say.The fire, which is currently 96% contained, killed three people and destroyed 1,500 structures, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. Attorneys are seeking compensation for plaintiffs’ damaged property, lost wages and attorney fees.The lawsuit claims that once the electricity was shut off on Nov. 12 — four days after the fire started —  residents and firefighters lost water pressure, hampering efforts to battle the flames. That in turn heightened the safety risk for firefighters and homeowners who sheltered in place.R. Rex Parris, one of the attorneys on the case, references the utility’s preliminary report filed Nov. 12 with the California Public Utility Commission stating an electric substation experienced a disturbance two minutes before the fire, which started in the same area. “The report is preliminary,” said Edison spokesman Steve Conroy when the report was made public. “We have no other information other than a line went out of service and we don’t know why.” In the report, the utility said a circuit in its Chatsworth substation near where the Woolsey fire started “relayed” two minutes before the fire broke out. “This means an outage remains until it is safe to manually reenergize the circuit,” Conroy said. “This is not a Public Safety Power Shutoff; it is simply a safety feature to help mitigate wildfire risk.”The lawsuit also blames Edison for potential damage to the environmental and public health caused by the burning of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory nuclear cleanup area, though some experts have said there was no damage. The state Department of Toxic Substances Control, which oversees the long-delayed cleanup of the former rocket engine testing and nuclear research facility, said fire officials believed the blaze “did not present any risks other than those normally present in a wildfire situation.”Edison said in an emailed statement that it cannot comment on lawsuits related to the Woolsey fire at this time and that it may take some time before an investigation into what caused the fire is completed.“SCE’s focus at this time is service restoration to customers still impacted in the Malibu area, and providing additional assistance to customers through  the L.A. County local assistance centers,” an Edison spokesman said. The utility said it’s offering support for customers looking to turn service on and off, waiving charges associated with extended bill payments and charges associated with relocating and starting new service. Parris said utility companies know of the dangers of high power lines running through fire zones, but that they do little to implement safeguards to prevent potential tragedies. “When you have rules that are this important and you know people are violating them it’s inevitable that these catastrophic events happen,” Parris said of Edison and other utility companies. “Their view of safety is public relations.” Victims of the Camp fire filed a lawsuit against Pacific Gas and Electric Co. also on Friday, alleging that utility is responsible for the fire that killed at least 79 people. ------2:05 p.m.: This article was updated with statements from R.

The sun was starting to dip. Monday was coming to an end.Since the Camp fire broke out on Nov. 8, authorities have been combing through crumbled homes and melted metal in an effort to locate and identify human remains.The fire has killed at least 79 people, and about 700 others are unaccounted for, a significant drop from a few days ago when the list was more than 26 pages and had more than 1,200 names, but still a daunting number.Now two storms are moving toward Northern California and are expected bring up to six inches of rain through Saturday, possibly hindering search operations.“The pros and cons are that the weather will be in our favor to contain the fire,” said Cal Fire spokesman Manuel Garcia.  “But the cons are that there will possibly be loose terrain, fallen trees, mudslides and downstream flows.”The National Weather Service said the first of the storms will move into the region on Wednesday. The second storm will bring the heaviest rain on Thursday night through Friday morning.Forecasters said the soil in the burn area cannot absorb rainwater, which could lead to fast-moving flows of mud, debris and even trees and boulders up to several feet deep that can be deadly.Blocked roads caused by the storms as well as rivers of ash and debris could hinder search crews from conducting a massive search operation in a burn zone that is bigger in area than the city of San Jose.Tom Madigan of the Alameda County Sheriff’s Department said that in some cases remains were so badly burned that they could not be recognized or just a few bones could be located.“We’re finding remains in various states,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said. “I suspect there are some that will have been completely consumed.”“There is certainly the unfortunate possibility that even after we’ve searched an area, once people get back in there, it’s possible that human remains could be found. I know that’s a very difficult thing to think about, but that’s the difficult situation we find ourselves in today. “Recovery workers in white jumpsuits and boots, firefighters, coroner employees and police chaplains from across the state have been working around the clock searching neighborhoods destroyed by the fire, but as the storms approach, the possibility of perhaps not finding everyone is starting to set in.

The sets, which include a sound stage on Mare Island, weren’t touched by the conflagrations, but the pervasive smoke that has shrouded much of the Bay Area has forced the show to temporarily halt shooting.The Paramount-produced series is one of a number of TV and commercial shoots that have experienced disruptions because of the fires that have devastated California in recent weeks. Some prime shooting locations — including Paramount Ranch, which serves as a set for HBO’s “Westworld,” and the Peter Strauss Ranch in Agoura Hills — have experienced extensive damage, rendering them inaccessible to crews. Large swaths of Malibu that are popular filming sites are also closed to production.Read more here.","dateModified":"2018-11-20T15:21:48.592Z","datePublished":"2018-11-20T15:05:00.000Z","headline":"California fires interrupt TV production","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"David Ng"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#california-fires-interrupt-tv-production"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"The National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch through Friday morning where the Camp fire raged through Butte County, Calif. While the rainfall will help with the firefight — the blaze is 70% contained and has burned 151,272 acres — neighborhoods that were destroyed, and those downstream of them, could see mudslides and debris flows.The Camp fire burn zone could see up to 6 inches of rain through Saturday, which isn’t unusual for that region, said Johnnie Powell, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Sacramento. In April, Paradise saw nearly 6 inches of rain in one day in what was its last significant storm.“Best-case scenario, it’ll rain on it and nothing will move. Worst-case scenario, the mud will start moving,” Powell said. “We just have to wait and see what happens. All we know for sure is, it’s going to rain really hard.”The soil in recently burned areas cannot absorb rainwater. Enough rain can lead to fast-moving flows of mud, debris and even trees and boulders that can be deadly for those in their path. The devastation often comes without warning.","dateModified":"2018-11-20T15:21:39.453Z","datePublished":"2018-11-20T15:02:00.000Z","headline":"California fires: New disaster danger in Paradise is mud and ash flows","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#california-fires-new-disaster-danger-in-paradise-is-mud-and-ash-flows"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"The two pilots were dropping water on a flank of the destructive Woolsey fire the day after it broke out when they got a request to rescue people stuck nearby on Castro Peak in the hills above Malibu. Their fuel supply was dwindling and thick smoke filled the air around them.

But there are certain words and conversations he’s learned to key in on.On Nov. 7, a call went out that someone had been shot outside the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks. Then another. Gorden listened to the drone of 911 calls picking up in the background. He realized there was nothing typical about this shooting.“When [officers] went inside and said they’re going to need a lot of ambulances, that’s when I realized this was a mass shooting,” said Gorden, 22.Gorden tweeted from @VCScanner — his Twitter account that has amassed a following of thousands — alerting many in the area to the shooting, including the first Los Angeles Times reporter on the scene. TweetJess Weihe had just been about to close her laptop when she saw Gorden's all-caps tweet about the shooting.She stayed awake for several hours, anxiously refreshing her feed for more updates. Many in Thousand Oaks shared a similar story of a sleepless night after seeing the tweet that rattled their community.\"Early on, the not knowing is the scariest part,\" said Weihe, who lives in Newbury Park.Within 24 hours, another disaster hit Ventura County. First one fire, then a second.Gorden heard the call for the Hill fire in Ventura County. As it grew, the Woolsey fire started in Ventura and Los Angeles counties. As it headed toward Oak Park, Gorden began tweeting. At one point, he worked for 48 hours straight without sleep. He didn’t slow down until this weekend.“A lot of people are saying that they found my information more helpful than what officials were putting out or were able to evacuate earlier than other people who evacuated Oak Park after all the gridlock.”Many said they relied on the account when they could smell smoke or see a fire but hadn't yet received an emergency alert.Cal Lutheran University senior Annabelle Worrall was in shock from the shooting, which took the life of Cal Lutheran alum Justin Meek, who graduated from the school in May.She was sitting across from her roommate at a table when she got a Twitter notification from @VCScanner about a wildfire. They couldn't believe it.\"Everyone was still freaked out from that day,\" said Worrall, 21.Worrall went to her house in Westlake Village and a few hours later, she had to evacuate again. She eventually ended up in Pasadena.\"We’re just exhausted. I’m exhausted,\" she said.Police scanners aren’t foolproof methods for learning about emergencies and authorities caution against reporting on what’s overheard. There are rules Gorden abides by when it comes to sharing information. Tactics that could compromise the safety of police officers, for example, are something he never touches.“Certain things shouldn’t be tweeted.”Gorden, who lives in Simi Valley, started the @VCScanner account in 2011. The first wildfire he actively covered was 2013’s Springs fire in Ventura County. But it was last year, during the Thomas fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, that people started paying more attention.“I learned a lot from that one. People need to leave before there’s an evacuation order. You can’t rely on authorities to always get you out on time.”In the case of the fires in Ventura County, Gorden said he heard from people who saw his tweets about 30 to 45 minutes before the official evacuation orders.Gorden’s @VCScanner account following grew from 6,000 to  26,000 after the Thomas fire and has doubled to 55,000 since this month’s back-to-back episodes.","dateModified":"2018-11-20T02:34:48.834Z","datePublished":"2018-11-19T23:24:00.000Z","headline":"He alerted people to the Thousand Oaks shooting, then warned of the California fires that came next","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ffd5571/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1400x788+0+2/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6b%2F1d%2F84c15a69546e9bbd56d729612ac7%2F900","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Colleen Shalby"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Soumya Karlamangla"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#he-alerted-people-to-the-thousand-oaks-shooting-then-warned-of-the-california-fires-that-came-next"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageVictims of the Camp fire filed a class action lawsuit against Pacific Gas & Electric Company alleging the utility is responsible for sparking the deadly blaze that killed at least 77 people and destroyed more than 11,000 homes.The lawsuit, filed Friday in a Butte County superior court by two law firms — Garner & Associates and Franklin D. Azar & Associates— alleges PG&E has a history of disregarding safety regulations to maximize corporate profits.Attorneys are asking that PG&E pay victims for their loss of property and other costs related to the fire. The lawsuit alleges PG&E has failed in the past to trim trees near power lines or proactively shutoff power in hazardous fire conditions, and that the fire was preventable. It references a report the utility filed that notified the California Public Utilities Commission of problems with a power line minutes before the Camp fire started.“PG&E observed by aerial patrol damage to a transmission tower on the Caribou-Palermo 115 kV Transmission line … in the area of the Camp fire,” the utility said in the report. The lawsuit also references radio transmission recordings of firefighters discussing a damaged transmission line near where the Camp fire started.A spokesman for the utility said the report was preliminary. PG&E had notified 70,000 customers that the utility may shut power off due to dangerous fire conditions, but no proactive power shutoffs were initiated. The lawsuit claims the company was negligent in failing to de-energize power lines in fire-prone conditions. One of the plaintiff’s attorneys urged people affected by the fire to report their claims against PG&E.  “We encourage people affected by the Camp Fire to not respond to robocallers, but to contact the Butte County Bar Association or your local attorney first,” said attorney Ivy Ngo. A representative for PG&E said the company is aware of the lawsuits regarding the fire. “The safety of our customers and the communities we serve is our highest priority,” said spokeswoman Lynsey Paulo in an emailed statement. “It’s important to remember that the cause of the Camp Fire has yet to be determined. Right now, our primary focus is on supporting first responders and positioning our employees to assess damage, restore service and rebuild infrastructure, and helping our communities.”On Wednesday, the utility said if it were found responsible for the fire, its liability would exceed its insurance coverage. Officials have not yet announced findings on its investigation of what caused the Camp fire. ------- 2:25 p.m.: This article was updated with a statement from PG&E and additional details about the lawsuit. This article was originally published at 1:45 p.m. ","dateModified":"2018-11-19T22:33:25.345Z","datePublished":"2018-11-19T22:23:00.000Z","headline":"Victims of the Camp fire file class action lawsuit against PG&E","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0b103ca/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff5%2F35%2Fddfcc8c5db832ab4b27b940ae50d%2Fla-lb-media-3065457-me-concow-survivor-kkn-15734-20181119-133629","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Alejandra Reyes-Velarde"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#victims-of-the-camp-fire-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-pg-e"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Here is a timeline of rain moving into the Paradise burn zone:Monday: Dry skies.Tuesday: Mostly dry skies with rain moving into coastal hills in afternoon and evening.Wednesday: Rain across Northern California.Thursday: Second storm system, with heaviest rain Thursday night and Friday morning; chance of debris flows..Friday: Heavy rain; chance of debris flows.Source: National Weather Service Tweet Tweet","dateModified":"2018-11-19T21:59:26.056Z","datePublished":"2018-11-19T21:39:00.000Z","headline":"California fires: A timeline of rain moving into the Paradise area","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#california-fires-a-timeline-of-rain-moving-into-the-paradise-area"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageA McDonald’s.

She stepped carefully over the broken tiles to photograph bits of damage: a charred patch of the sprinkler system, a garage window that had shattered.Perhaps the strangest thing was their massive metal storage container, bigger than a dumpster, that had somehow been spun around and flung across the blackened land behind the house. The Thompsons feared it might tumble down the ravine, warning Alex not to get too close.“Where’s the beehive that was under the container?” Alex asked as he zipped back and forth, a toy dog in his hand.“It’s gone.

Around noon Sunday, Valerie and Edward Nalbentian walked north along the shoulder of Pacific Coast Highway near Zuma View Place in Malibu, heading to a home they said they knew had burned down.“We haven’t seen it yet,” Valerie said, her expression grim. “But we’ve seen plenty of pictures.”They had had the Point Dume house for only a year and a half, she said. In the aftermath of the disaster, the couple was preoccupied by trying to find somewhere to rent. In just a few days, she said, someone had hiked the rent on somewhere she was eyeing by $2,000 a month — raising their prices amid the booming demand, she said.“People are renting places without even looking at them because there’s such a shortage,” she said.A Los Angeles County Fire Department vehicle slowed alongside them and the driver asked if they needed a ride. The Nalbentians took him up on the offer, piling into the two spare seats for the sobering drive up to Point Dume.Farther south, Mimi Goldfinger gazed up at the scarred hillside at the intersection of Latigo Canyon Road and Pacific Coast Highway, cradling a fluffy white dog in her arms. Before, she said, “it was all lush.”She and her husband, Morris, were waiting to return to their home in a gated community and find out whether it had survived.From their hotel near Los Angeles International Airport, they had heard bits and pieces from the utility workers who had been dispatched to do work in the aftermath of the disaster — and who were staying at the same Sheraton hotel — as well as the security company their community had hired to patrol the area. They knew that other homes above and below had been destroyed, but “I don’t know about our house,” Mimi said.She was wearing the black athletic pants she had on when she headed to the gym the morning that the fires broke out, before she discovered that the shops had no electricity and realized what was going on. When she got back to the house, Morris was packing up.“I grabbed almost nothing,” he said.“The laptop,” Mimi replied.“And the dog,” he added.“And the daughter!” Mimi said, smiling.Disaster assistance centers will be open Monday in Malibu and Agoura Hills to help residents replace records lost in the blaze, file insurance claims and apply for disaster assistance.","dateModified":"2018-11-18T22:23:59.332Z","datePublished":"2018-11-18T22:05:00.000Z","headline":"California fires: Heading to a Malibu home they said they knew had burned down","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#california-fires-heading-to-a-malibu-home-they-said-they-knew-had-burned-down"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Finland’s president isn’t sure where U.S. President Trump got the idea that raking is part of his country’s routine for managing its substantial forests.Trump told reporters Saturday while visiting the ruins of the Northern California town where a fire killed at least 76 people that wildfires weren’t a problem in Finland because crews “spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things” to clear forest floors.Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said in an interview published Sunday in the Ilta-Sanomat newspaper that he spoke briefly with Trump about forest management on Nov. 11, when they were in Paris for Armistice Day events.Niinisto said their conversation focused on the California wildfires and the surveillance system Finland uses to monitor forests for fires.

homes, killed at least 71 people and left more than 1,000 unaccounted for.The cause of the Camp fire is still under investigation, but there is suspicion that, like several of the wine country blazes last year, it was sparked by power lines. PG&E said a transmission line in the area went offline 15 minutes before the fire was first reported, and the company found a damaged transmission tower near where investigators have said the fire began.PG&E has said weather conditions “did not warrant” a shut-off but has declined to explain further. Utility officials have said a preemptive blackout would probably not have prevented the Camp fire, even if power lines turn out to be the cause.

If the rain does come, the weather service expects the area to get a quarter to three-quarters of an inch of rain.  Tweet Tweet","dateModified":"2018-11-18T15:34:27.928Z","datePublished":"2018-11-18T15:14:00.000Z","headline":"Smoke continues to choke Northern California, but relief on the way","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Alejandra Reyes-Velarde"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#smoke-continues-to-choke-northern-california-but-relief-on-the-way"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"The destruction from the Woolsey fire keeps expanding.As of Sunday morning, the fire had destroyed more than 1,100 structures.The fire is now 88% contained, having burned nearly 97,000 acres from Oak Park and Malibu. Three people have died.","dateModified":"2018-11-18T15:13:35.689Z","datePublished":"2018-11-18T15:08:00.000Z","headline":"California fires: Number of structures destroyed in Woolsey fire tops 1,100","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#california-fires-number-of-structures-destroyed-in-woolsey-fire-tops-1-100"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe number of structures destroyed in the Woolsey fire jumped above 1,000, officials said Saturday night, establishing it as one of the most destructive Southern California wildfires in years.The new damage estimates come as firefighters continue to make progress in containing the blaze.

That tweet, posted a week ago, blamed the wildfires on poor forest management and misappropriation of funds.For Armstrong, the erroneous remark added what she said was a new level of betrayal by the president.“To say what he says, to tweet what he tweets, then to come and act like he cares about what is going on here is absurd,” she said. “He’s still the president. He shouldn’t speak so badly about people [in crisis]. He hates California.”Armstrong said she spent six days holed up in her niece’s Van Nuys apartment with her cat and dog. She returned, grateful to be alive and her home still standing. The worry, she said, has turned to anger as she thinks about the president descending on her home state.“He’s only visiting because he got so much flak and negative feedback” from his tweet, she said.Nine days ago, the deadly Woolsey fire forced tens of thousands of people from their homes and left three dead. On Saturday, some of those who fled — such as 47-year-old Ryan Victor —  found themselves trying to return to the natural rhythm of life.Up first on Victor’s list: pick up the pile of mail that has accumulated since he was evacuated from his Topanga home.But as he went about his errands, he said he had become numb to Trump’s rhetoric but that this was different.“The idiotic things that comes out of his mouth doesn’t register much anymore,” he said. “But I’m outraged over the hypocrisy.”He noted the president’s tweet that seemed to place the blame for the wildfire on California and its policies, followed by what now seems like a show of support and compassion by visiting.“With him, as long as he signs the check” to help with the recovery “and doesn’t withhold federal funds for forest management, that’s all that matters,” he said.Everything else: “It’s a lot of noise.”For Victor, there’s no way Trump can redeem himself.“He has no credibility,” he said as he grasped the leash of Luna, his Australian shephard.  “What is he going to do? Come here and throw paper towels at people like its Puerto Rico?”On Saturday, people teemed in and out of the Topanga Post Office to pick up mail. Some people carried plastic bins to haul their mail; others hugged thick stacks close to their chest.Jesse Gordon, 49, clutched junk mail, grocery advertisements and letters. His Topanga home was spared.  He said he opposes many of Trump’s policies but thinks the president’s visit could be a step in the right direction.But it will take more than a visit, Gordon said, adding that Trump might redeem himself by supporting and crafting policies that protect the coast and parks and address climate change.He said he hopes Trump learns that “it’s not about pointing the finger.

Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom on Saturday toured the devastation left by the Camp fire in Paradise, Calif. Along with Jody Jones, Paradise’s mayor and Brock Long, director of the  Federal Emergency Management Agency, Trump walked through a smoky haze among the ruins of Skyway Villa Mobile Home and RV Park. He held his hands to his waist and looked around him, surveying the damage of the state’s most destructive wildfire that killed 71 people with more than 1,000 unaccounted for. Light ash was still falling in the area, but Trump, Brown and Newsom did not wear masks. California representatives Kevin McCarthy and Doug LaMalfa were in attendance, but did not walk around the area with Trump. Trump listened to officials, who spoke to him about the many who sheltered in place from the fire, including patients at a nearby hospital and a K-Mart store. He asked about the Wal Mart in Chico.\"By 5 o'clock, Paradise was completely gone,\" Jones said told Trump.  TweetTrump then stopped to briefly address reporters. He lauded law enforcement’s efforts and offered support to the representatives accompanying him. He, along with Brown, vowed to work together to help the state recover. \"Nobody would have ever thought this could have happened,\" he said. \"The federal government is behind you, we're all behind each other.\"“Kevin, anything we can do, you know we’re here,” he continued, speaking to McCarthy. “You just bring it over to the office, okay?”  Trump made reference to his earlier comments about better forest management, citing Finland as a good example of country that keeps its forest clear. But his comments were more restrained.“We have to do management, maintenance and we’ll be working also with environmental groups,” he said. “I think everybody’s seen the light on that.”Later, when a reporter asked if his opinions on climate change have changed since wildfires have ravaged the state, Trump replied simply: “No.”That morning, the presidential motorcade had driven past scorched fields as well as destroyed homes and burned out cars.Along the route are some bystanders who are holding Trump signs.One man was holding a garden rake to which he taped a sign that said: “Our Fault: Really?”The president is expected to fly to Southern California Saturday afternoon to assess the Woolsey fire’s damage.-------1:10 p.m.: This article was updated throughout with details about Trump’s tour of Paradise. This article was originally published at 12:03 p.m. ","dateModified":"2018-11-17T22:06:58.127Z","datePublished":"2018-11-17T21:08:00.000Z","headline":"California fires: Trump, Brown, Newsom survey the Paradise devastation, vow to work together","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Times Staff"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#california-fires-trump-brown-newsom-survey-the-paradise-devastation-vow-to-work-together"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageOn the morning the Camp fire broke out, Pam Weaver was talking to her cousin on the phone about California’s recovery from the Santa Rosa fires last year.Just then, she looked out her window and saw embers flying everywhere. She had to evacuate.One week later, Weaver waited in line Saturday at the disaster recovery center at the Chico Mall. The line at the center, managed by Butte County and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was hundreds of people long, snaking around the building.Victims of the Camp fire waited to begin the process of replacing their official documents, such as birth certificates and Social Security cards, and to apply for FEMA aid.The same morning, President Trump’s motorcade passed through Chico. He arrived at Beale Air Force Base just before 10 a.m. and was scheduled to meet with firefighters and victims of the destructive Camp fire, which has burned 148,000 acres and killed 71 people. Weaver said that the president’s visit makes her feel like her town is “not forgotten.”“I think it’s going to make the community feel like they’re important,” she said.Trump was  criticized last week for erroneously blaming the fires on poor forest management and threatening to cut off funding to California. He has since taken a more conciliatory tone.  Tweet”We are with you all the way — God Bless you all!” he tweeted Saturday morning as he made his way to California.Sean Bandstra, 43, who voted for Trump, said the president’s comments about the fires were “offensive.” Bandstra, of Magalia, lost his home, but got a one-bedroom apartment in Orland.“And that’s the first thing he comes up with?” Bandstra said. “I could do without him.”Pam Kopping, 46, still gets the chills when she thinks about her escape from Paradise. Kopping remembers ash falling like rain as she filled her gas tank and hardly being able to see or breathe as she drove out of town.“I’m so thankful to be here,” she said.Kopping, along with her two sons, ages 6 and 10, are staying with an aunt in Chico and will be moving into an apartment in a month.“I’m one of the lucky ones,” she said. “There are thousands of us looking.”Her children’s charter school may set up portable trailers in Chico so the kids don’t have to start all over at school and get to maintain some normalcy, she said.Deborah Clark, 57, and her husband, 71, are staying in the living room of her sister’s house in Los Molinos, about 30 miles northwest of Chico. Her home at the Holly Hills mobile home park is “totaled,” along with all the other trailers there.“I was ready to go down with the house,” she said. “My husband and the fireman shoved me into the car.”She had to leave her two cats behind, ages 12 and 2, and she’s hoping they got taken to an animal shelter. Clark and her husband are on fixed incomes. She’s hoping federal officials can help her find more permanent housing.“We just paid rent the day before the fire,” she said.She hopes to get another mobile home and someday go back to Paradise.“It checked off every box we ever dreamed of for retirement,” Clark said. “It was everything that the name implied.”Clark said she’s glad the president was paying a visit to see the destruction of the fire.“It’s good that he’s coming to actually see it,” she said.

On Friday, he spent the afternoon surveying the damage to properties off Skyway west of Clark Road from the most destructive, deadliest wildfire of them all.“I see the areas [where] I used to go shopping and be a part of,” said a melancholic Hakala. “I kind of knew this area.”Wearing yellow turnouts, thick boots and a helmet, Hakala circled the cinderblock walls that hid the gutted interior of a two-story home.He leaned down and picked up a piece of broken glass. It fit like a puzzle piece with the other shards that lay around it flat on the ground, still recognizable as the shape of a window.The glass didn’t look thick to the untrained eye, but to Hakala, it was. If it had been a dual-paned window, it would have been thinner and possibly had a filmy sheen from the argon gas used to maximize thermal efficiency.He pointed to the square hole in the wall it fell from — the top of it had metal framing — another telltale sign of a single-pane window, he said.Next to the glass, under dirt, ash, debris, blackened twisted metal and a piece of that window frame, he pointed to a piece of gravely skinned material that blended in with everything around it but bore significance to him.“This is composition shingles, because it’s kind of rough like that,” he said, running his index finger over the top. “If it was tile … it’d be in the body of the structure.”Every detail — from the shape and material of a home’s eaves and the size of its vents to the types of windows and walls it’s framed in — will be added into an ever-growing database Cal Fire is building about Paradise.“All that data is ultimately going toward finding out why homes are burning down,” Hakala said.The job is simple but meticulous.The damage assessors divided Butte County’s burnt ridges into zones and smaller divisions. They use parcel maps to determine where properties are supposed to be, then go lot to lot, circling what’s left of the building on foot. They make notes on an app on their cellphone.One damage assessor said he can survey between 60 and 100 properties in a day, depending on the density of the area and complexity of the scene.More than 12,000 buildings were destroyed in the 146,000-acre Camp fire, with at least 9,700 of those being single-family homes like the one Hakala was inspecting on Friday. The entire area will eventually be searched, he said. All of that information is transmitted back to headquarters, where it’s compiled and ultimately used to create the map the public sees online that shows which homes are destroyed, suffered major or minor damage or came out of the blaze unscathed. ImageThe Camp fire, Hakala said, is the worst fire he’s seen of his career.“[It’s] the damage and destruction,” he said. “I was at Carr — that was devastating this year — I was at Napa, I was at Thomas, I was at the Mendo and all of those fires had their own genuine feel. But this one in particular is pretty catastrophic. The intensity it came through at … someone mentioned it was eight football fields a minute. That’s crazy.”Hakala walked around to the front of the building and pointed to the garage. Among the other indications that the building was once a home, that was an obvious one. Inspectors not only note if the buildings are residential or commercial, but how close they are to vegetation, propane tanks, and any other structures.Every piece fits into the larger conversation about homes in the wildland-urban interface.He kicked a rock by the front door, and its face fractured and fell to the ground like pieces of slate tile. That’s how intense the heat and fire got on this side of the home.About 60 feet away, near where the land begins to slope and form the shoulder of the ridge, he pointed out branches halfway up a tree. All the leaves were cooked, intact, and pointing the exact same direction, southwest toward the slope.It’s what firefighters call a “foliage freeze,” when wind from the firestorm causes green vegetation to point in a singular direction and the searing heat dries and “freezes” it in place.All around the home, signs of why it burned emerged.It was surrounded by conifers, Hakala said. Without a doubt, that roof had a layer of dried needles resting on top, perfect kindling to put fire directly onto the home.“Other than direct flame impingement, it’s more about where the embers are landing,” Hakala said.Even the most fire-resistant building can be felled by one weakness in the armor. Or, on the contrary, by sheer luck they can remain standing.Down the road from where Hakala was working, two homes in a wide clearing of brush — one with modern construction and one older — were undamaged. Yet homes nearby with equally cleared land were completely destroyed.A common thread among all the destroyed homes has yet to reveal itself, Hakala said. There’s more data to crunch.All investigators know is that much of the damage was caused by flying embers hopping from home to home, starting fires that created more embers to start more fires.“I’ve learned that basically fire departments are having a hard time fighting the fires. There’s nothing that could’ve been done here except for saving people’s lives and get people out, which was the main goal,” Hakala said. “When you have a fire of this magnitude there’s little you can do from the suppression side to fight that fire. You just get people out.”The death toll from the fire is 71 and sure to grow. More than 1,000 people were considered unaccounted for as of Friday.","dateModified":"2018-11-17T19:17:55.289Z","datePublished":"2018-11-17T18:37:00.000Z","headline":"California fire: Why did some Paradise homes burn and others survive?

That means most people who breathe the air there can experience health problems, regardless of age or fitness level, said Jenny Tan, a spokeswoman for the Yolo-Solano Air Quality Management District.Several Bay Area and Sacramento area schools have closed because of poor air quality from the Camp fire’s smoke, including UC Berkeley, Mills College, Stanford University, the University of the Pacific, Cal State East Bay and Sacramento State University. When UC Davis announced it was closing its campus because of smoke, it offered students a limited amount of face masks. The city of Sacramento said in a statement that staff will continue distributing its remaining N95 masks. Beilenson said the masks don’t fit children and men with beards, and can be dangerous for those with heart and respiratory diseases. The masks can make it more difficult to breathe because of carbon dioxide buildup, he said.“Thats a good 50 plus of the population that couldn't benefit from them,” he said. Though some healthy adults could benefit from wearing them, the face masks offer too much of a false sense of security and they would need to be fitted specifically for each person, Beilenson said.“I saw a young woman was wearing an N95 mask and running full speed through a park— again, a false sense of security,” he said. Workers who need to be outside for extended periods of time are the only ones who really benefit from the masks, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration already requires those employees to wear them, Beilenson said.“By far the most important thing for anyone across the age spectrum and health condition spectrum is not to go outdoors, and if you need to, make it short and don’t exert yourself,” he said. “Bottom line.”The county’s decision comes even after the state’s Office of Emergency Services recommended the masks earlier this week.

The costs of some materials are rising, thanks in part to President Trump’s trade war.“The individual homeowner just has a nightmare ahead,” said John Mulville, Southern California regional director for real estate research firm Metrostudy.In all, the still-burning fires in Northern and Southern California have destroyed more than 12,800 structures, swelling shelters and raising questions about whether it’s smart to rebuild in areas prone to wildfires.Any loss of housing is a hit in a state that’s seen the cost of living soar.

ImageReed’s home was one of at least 9,700 destroyed in the first hours of the blaze. She lost pretty much everything but her family. No photo albums made it; a cookbook of family recipes is gone forever.Despite it all, she’s trying to keep a positive outlook, she said. She had fire insurance, which many residents in the foothill community say puts her in a much better position to recover than most.“Every single day, I seem to be getting happier. It’s just stuff. Yes, it’s wedding photos and recipes. But it’s just photos and recipes. I’m alive,” she said.Reed’s adult daughter and her kids survived too — but barely, Reed said. They were trying to run from their burning neighborhood when a fire truck towing a bulldozer that was driving by picked them up as flames wrapped around the road.“The firefighters told her to put her kids in the bulldozer and then lie on top of them. If a tree fell on them, the bulldozer would protect them,” Reed recalled.Since the fire, she’s been holed up with 10 other relatives nearby.“It’s 11 people. Seven dogs. Four reptiles. All I need is a partridge, and I’ll have a Christmas song,” she joked.Since the fire, companies expecting bill payments have been accommodating, residents said. But there’s a greater sense of urgency for the other side of that coin — paychecks for those who lost everything.That’s why Tim Bolin, 59, and his wife were in line. As executive pastor for Paradise Alliance Church, he’s responsible for the payroll. Sixteen of his 21 employees lost their homes and are “scattered all over, from 100 miles north to 100 miles south,” he said. Another employee’s home was looted.“There’s checks that have come in. There’s some bills that have to get paid. I hope people are patient,” he said.Earlier this week, a sheriff’s deputy escorted Bolin to the church so he could recover computers, servers and documents. He was relieved to find the building standing after seeing photos of a wall of fire approaching and hearing residents say they saw it on fire. The front plants were charred, but the property survived, Bolin said.","dateModified":"2018-11-16T19:18:43.982Z","datePublished":"2018-11-16T18:53:00.000Z","headline":"California fire: Camp fire evacuees line up for hours to get mail, paychecks","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f0e682f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1536x864+0+592/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa6%2F65%2Fa6abb4914ecd61a877bcaaff8e86%2Fla-lb-media-20181116-084958-20181116-101256","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Joseph Serna"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#california-fire-camp-fire-evacuees-line-up-for-hours-to-get-mail-paychecks"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageOfficials investigating the Hill fire said Friday morning they’ve ruled out all potential causes other than human activity. The blaze burned 4,531 acres before being 100% contained Friday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Officials are asking people who were in the area of Hill Canyon Trail between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. on Nov. 8 and may have information about the fire to call Cal Fire’s tip line at (800) 468-4408. ”A reward of $10,000 is available for information leading to a possible responsible party,” Cal Fire said. ","dateModified":"2018-11-16T19:09:31.416Z","datePublished":"2018-11-16T18:07:00.000Z","headline":"Investigators say they’ve ruled out all possible causes for Hill fire except human activity","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/09248be/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+79/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F61%2Ff1%2Fd67ffa45162dcc65cf0ace68ff86%2Fla-lb-media-3064801-la-me-hill-fire9-mam-20181116-100043","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Alejandra Reyes-Velarde"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#investigators-say-theyve-ruled-out-all-possible-causes-for-hill-fire-except-human-activity"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageWith hundreds of people still missing, and hundreds of thousands displaced across California because of the recent fires, many outside the burn zones may be looking to donate time, money or space.

The faint smell of smoke lingered in the air.Ali Reza Ahmadian, 34, was trying to get supplies to his father and sister, who live across the street from Zuma Beach. The downtown Los Angeles resident had been able to get food and water to his dad this week, but he couldn’t get through Thursday.“They were letting people with local driver’s licenses in,” he said. “Then they had escorts.

Jerry Brown and Trump administration officials toured the devastation in the Woolsey fire zone and officials prepared for President Trump’s visit to Paradise, Calif., on Saturday.A few days ago, the president was criticized for a recent tweet that incorrectly stated the fires were the result of poor forest management. The tweet also threatened to cut off funding to California. Trump since has spoken to Brown, saying he was “completely behind California.”Brown met with U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and state fire officials in Camarillo.Zinke and Brown had toured the scene of the Camp fire that devastated Paradise in Northern California on Wednesday.At a news conference, Zinke and Brown pledged to work together to help those recovering from the state’s fire siege.“This is my fourth time to California, all of which have been fires,” Zinke said. “And every time I come back, I say this is the worst fire I’ve seen. Yesterday is the worst fire I’ve seen.“Paradise unfortunately likely will not be the same city.”In light of the large-scale fires that have devastated California communities in recent years, Brown emphasized the importance of designing safer cities to mitigate the effects of climate change.“There are fires and there are going to be more fires,” Brown said. “California is a rich state, but we have to take intelligent precautions with how we design our cities.”Zinke suggested the importance of prescribed burns and removing dead trees in order to make sure fuel supplies are reduced.Zinke introduced Brown on Thursday: “Despite the rumors, we get along. We talk a lot. We talked a lot before this incident. We talk on water. We talk on fires. We talk on forest management. We even talk about his dog Colusa.”Brown added, “We are truly working together to serve our people.”“President Trump told me that they will do everything possible to help California in its time of need,” Brown said. “I think we are on the right path right now and we are all going to work together.”","dateModified":"2018-11-16T01:10:08.704Z","datePublished":"2018-11-16T00:20:00.000Z","headline":"After Trump eruption, bipartisanship reigns as Brown and Zinke emphasize cooperation on fire recovery","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Javier Panzar"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#after-trump-eruption-bipartisanship-reigns-as-brown-and-zinke-emphasize-cooperation-on-fire-recovery"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageWhen Phoebe Scott saw Thunder, Luke and Gidget in a Los Angeles Times photograph last week, she was alarmed by the image’s apocalyptic and bleak appearance.It didn’t look like that, she said, when she left the two alpacas and horse at Zuma Beach to find shelter for other animals, including five goats waiting for her in her Mini Cooper.Scott, a board member for the nonprofit Big Heart Ranch, immediately began thinking about how she could use the photo to locate the alpacas and horse, just three of the 66 therapy animals evacuated Friday from the Malibu property.  She thought the photo couldn’t have been snapped much longer after she had left because she had taken a photograph on her phone of a distressed owl on the sandy beach. It appeared to be the same owl that Los Angeles Times photographer Wally Skalij snapped just an hour before finding the alpacas tied to the lifeguard stand.Skalij said he was drawn to the area when he saw horses on the beach, and then the unusual sight of the owl.“It was surreal,” he said. “It looked like a scene from Noah’s ark.” Thunder, Luke and Gidget were meant to be on a trailer headed to a safe location, but they ended up at the animal evacuation zone on Zuma Beach because the trailers were blocked from entering Big Heart Ranch, Scott said. She walked along the beach, asking anyone with a trailer to help her transport the animals.“It felt like a really long time we were trying to locate them, but it was actually only a matter of hours,” she said. ImageShe found someone with a trailer and left the animals with a caretaker while she drove the other animals to a safe haven.The alpacas and the horse were never left alone, she said. But after she left, she didn’t know where they ended up because poor cellphone reception made it impossible to get in touch with the caretaker and volunteers watching over the animal trio.  “It was chaos,” she said.  Scott would contact the photographer, she decided, and figure out when the photo was taken and who could have been at the beach at that time. Before long, friends, strangers and Big Heart Ranch donors saw Skalij’s haunting photo and beat her to it.Her phone was flooded with text messages, voicemails and notifications as people shared the image in hopes of locating animals they thought were missing. The image was even being used by other animal rescue organizations for fundraising.“People were so concerned,” she said. “People do share some things too quickly, and misinformation gets spread, but their hearts are good.” Scott said she wanted people to know the animals are doing well but the ranch needs help.“Thunder and Luke are on a lovely piece of property up in Ojai, and Gidget is in Glendale’s Silver Spur Stables,” she said. Half of Big Heart Ranch’s property and the animals’ caretaker’s home were destroyed. It’s a miracle, she said, that all 66 animals — including the guinea pigs — are safe. Because the organization is supported entirely by donations, it will take time to raise the money to rebuild, Scott said.

But first there was a very long hug, and some tears.\"We don't know what it's going to look like,\" said Craft, whose house is gone. \"We don't know what school's going to look like. But we're sure going to try to have a season.\"Basketballs echoed in the cavernous gym, as the girls dribbled down the shiny wooden court. Well-aimed balls swished through the nets. There were happy cries and swinging ponytails and somehow the girls were able to ignore the swirling ash outside, the cement-colored sky, the salmon-colored disc of a smoke-tinged sun.\"We're staying at a cousin's house in Chico,\" Tessa Lawrie told junior varsity coach Michaella Gonzales. Lawrie, who is 47, has lost her home in Paradise. Her 15-year-old daughter is running down the court. Gonzales, 28, teaches at Paradise Elementary School. Her campus and her Magalia home have burned to the ground.\"We're staying there with my mom and stepdad,\" Lawrie continued. \"They lost their house as well. One big happy family having a slumber party. We've had 10 every night for the last week. Along with three cats, two dogs, a hamster, a rabbit.\"The fish tank didn't make it out.\"We have to keep smiling and going through the motions,\" Lawrie said. \"We're thankful we're alive. Thankful that we got out and we have our kids. They need some sort of normalcy right now. Their whole world has been turned upside down. Most of them couldn't grab anything. They were at school. They have the clothes on their backs.\"Anne Stearns, PHS's athletic director, arrived. She was one of the lucky ones. She lives in Chico and still has a house. She talked about survivor guilt and about the haven she can offer the athletes who have no place to stay. Most nights there are at least 10, an ever-changing cast of couch-surfing high schoolers.\"I have 200 athletes [at PHS]\" Stearns said. \"I know of five who have houses standing. Of those five, you think about it, do they really have homes? Homes in a landscape of just barren...\"  She paused. \"Ash. What kind of a house is that?\"Stearns talked about a volleyball player who's been wearing the same clothes for the past six days, laundering them occasionally in Stearns' washing machine. The girl has a house. And feels terrible about it. \"She's wearing flip flops,\" Stearns said. Sure, she has a house, but she can't get to it or any of her belongings because authorities are still looking for remains and putting out spot fires. \"We're giving shoes [to] everyone. She says, 'I don't need anything.'\"The overnight low is in the 30s in Chico. And all she has on her feet are flip-flops.By 9:30 a.m., Craft called a team meeting before practice could begin in earnest. The girls sat at the edge of the court, faces raised, expectant. A clutch of parents stood at the edges of the group. The good news: Of the three women's basketball teams at Paradise High — varsity, junior varsity and freshman — all the players have been accounted for. No one knows when they'll be in class together again. There's been a Paradise diaspora.Still.\"We will have a basketball team,\" Craft said. \"We will have games as long as everybody is wanting to stay and play. Parents, don't worry about transportation. We have so many teachers who don't have work. They'll drive you.”She talked about logistics, when there will be practices, how to get information and transportation and clothes. When the first game will be, Nov. 27 against Lassen High in Susanville.Every game this season will be an away game. Even if it's supposed to be a home game. Paradise High is still standing. But there's not much else left in the town of 26,000 or so.Still.\"The season is not about winning anything, doing anything great,\" Craft said. \"It's about us staying together. We can't lose a whole season of learning.\"She teared up.\"Our goal for basketball is to love basketball. If you love basketball, you're really going to love it. For right now, this is about what we have.\"Nino Pinocchio, former football coach at Paradise High and Butte College, echoed Craft's sentiment. His daughter, Jasmine, 15, is at practice with a broken toe. It doesn't matter. She's still there.\"You are bringing smiles to people's faces,\" he said. \"Go out there. Work hard. Get better. That's what the community needs us to do.\"And then there's a kind of Cinderella moment in the midst of all the devastation. Rheann Colwell, a 16-year-old junior, came to practice in black jeans, a black T-shirt and sandals. Her home in Paradise is a pile of ash. What clothes she could grab before evacuating were in Weaverville, at her grandparents' house.She raised her hand at the end of the meeting. She needed shoes.Craft kicked off her black slip-ons. They were size 9.5, too big. Snider handed over her red Chuck Taylor All Stars. Size 7.5, too small. Kylee Weinbarger, 15, ran to her bag and returned with another pair of well-worn Chucks.These were white, well, sort of white, size 8.5, a perfect fit.Practice began.","dateModified":"2018-11-15T21:29:44.628Z","datePublished":"2018-11-15T21:11:00.000Z","headline":"Out of 15 girls and two coaches, only one person on this Paradise High School basketball team still has a home","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c007225/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0a%2F7a%2F1c9aa83f40efe9dda8fa60ed43d7%2Fla-lb-media-imagefromios3-20181115-122904","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#out-of-15-girls-and-two-coaches-only-one-person-on-this-paradise-high-school-basketball-team-still-has-a-home"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"President Trump plans to visit California on Saturday “to meet with individuals impacted by the wildfires,” a White House spokeswoman said Thursday.His visit will come a week after he was roundly criticized for erroneous comments he made about the causes of the California fires and for threatening to cut off funding.Read more here.","dateModified":"2018-11-15T20:49:36.540Z","datePublished":"2018-11-15T20:43:00.000Z","headline":"Trump plans to visit California fire devastation","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Noah Bierman"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#trump-plans-to-visit-california-fire-devastation"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageRandy Couch stood on the side of Kanan Road on Thursday morning, his cellphone on speaker mode as he waited. He had been on hold with Southern California Edison for 20 minutes, trying to get information about when power would return to his home.Couch, who has been a resident of the Seminole Springs Mobile Home Park in Agoura Hills since 1981, lives along a creek that cuts through the park in a private cul-de-sac. The homes on his side of the creek — the one closer to Mulholland Highway — were spared by the Woolsey fire, he said. His brother’s home survived too.But most of the houses on the other side burned, the electrical contractor said, adding that 101 of his 215 neighbors had lost everything.Couch’s home has been powered by a generator since the electricity went out. He’s been able to cook and do laundry. But the area has no cellphone reception, so he has to leave to make any calls.Couch and his wife evacuated at 3 a.m. Friday and hopped from park to park in his RV until landing in the parking lot of a Home Depot in West Hills.He sneaked back into his neighborhood Tuesday, intent on making a meeting with housing officials. Now he and his wife are waiting for a roadblock to be moved so they can go back down the hill and get their cat, which is still in their RV and needs to be fed.Still on hold with Edison, Couch said he’s frustrated by the lack of communication.“The Highway Patrol doesn’t know anything, other than Edison doesn’t want people in,” he said as a large truck drove by with a downed power pole in tow. “Nobody knows what’s happening.

As a result, the universities have stopped most operations, officials said. At Cal State East Bay’s three campuses in Hayward, Oakland and Concord, all classes, work and events were canceled. Only dining halls, residence halls and the campuses’ student health centers remained open, university officials said.“These conditions change and are unpredictable and we are continually monitoring pollution levels,” university officials said in a statement. “In any case, we should take precautions for the health and welfare of students, staff and faculty. These include checking air quality reports and curtailing or canceling outdoor activities and events as appropriate. Building HVAC systems have been set to recirculate and not draw in outside air.”The university said it is monitoring air quality daily and will decide whether classes will resume Friday. At Santa Clara University, classes, events and most operations will remain closed through the weekend. Residence halls, the campus health center and a library will remain open. The men’s basketball game Thursday evening and women’s volleyball game Friday will continue as planned. “We continue to pray for all those impacted by the devastation of the fire,” university President Michael Engh in a statement. “While the fire is nearly 200 miles away from campus, the air quality in our region is impacted. The health and safety of our students is our highest priority.”Sacramento State University and UC Davis canceled classes Tuesday, and on Thursday the campuses  remained closed.Jenny Tan, a spokeswoman for the Yolo-Solano Air Quality Management District, said the “unhealthy” category in the air quality index means that people can experience health problems regardless of age or fitness level.“Most people may experience symptoms like a runny nose, watery eyes, headaches and difficulty breathing,” she said. The symptoms are more serious for vulnerable groups, like children, the elderly and people with asthma and other health conditions. The air quality can change quickly because winds and weather conditions can shift smoke. Although the Sacramento and Bay areas are more than 200 miles away from the Camp fire in Butte County, officials are recommending that people stay indoors.“We’re recommending for people to really not be outside,” Tan said. “Limit the amount of time you are out there.” ---------11:15 a.m.: This article was updated to include information about Santa Clara University. This article was originally published at 9:24 a.m.  Tweet","dateModified":"2018-11-15T20:50:08.060Z","datePublished":"2018-11-15T19:13:00.000Z","headline":"Bay Area colleges close because of smoke from the Camp fire","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/581162d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbc%2F3a%2Fd56ef853326e3a438d99bb6d51c6%2Fla-lb-media-3065243-me-camp-fire-kkn-21298-20181115-084953","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Alejandra Reyes-Velarde"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#bay-area-colleges-close-because-of-smoke-from-the-camp-fire"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe University of California and California State University systems are extending the deadline for students applying to the 2019 undergraduate class and offering application fee waivers to those affected by fires ravaging the state. “We know this is a tremendously difficult time for prospective students and their families who have been impacted by the devastating wildfires,” UC President Janet Napolitano said in a statement. “This is one small way the university can offer support.”To request an extension for a UC application, students should:  Create a UC application account for admission to the fall 2019 class.

A third of the hands went up. How many knew someone who had lost a home? More than half raised their hands.Lorenzen said he had increased staffing 70% in anticipation of the winds last Thursday, but that extra staffing was no match for how fast the fires grew.The Hill fire crossed the 101 Freeway in 12 minutes, he said. Thirty minutes after it began, the Woolsey fire broke out between Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley. It was just 1,000 acres at first, he said.“Then the wind hit, and we all know what happens after that,” he said.In Ventura County, 95 structures were lost to fire, he said. He emphasized that though some people lost their homes, many other properties had been saved.“We legitimately had everybody that was available out there protecting your families and your homes,” he said. “I’m deeply sorry for your loss. I am so thankful that you’re all here to join us and that we can share in this process and help you on the road to recovery.”Ventura County Supervisor Linda Parks told the crowd a story about local off-duty firefighter Mike Williams, who left his own home to help save a neighbor’s. While he was trying to put out the blaze, his house burned down.“It's just an example of the type of people we have in our community,” she said.“Our county has a lot of experience, unfortunately, dealing with fires,” said Parks, referring to the Thomas fire last year, which at the time was the most destructive in California history. “We've become a bit of experts on how to recover from fires.”Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub said that evacuations began half an hour after the Hill fire broke out.“Even though we were heavily impacted by the Borderline incident, we did not skip a beat when the time came to assess for evacuations,” he said, referring to the mass shooting last week at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks. He said they evacuated nearly 95,000 people, with no injuries. “I'm not even aware of any traffic collisions,” he said. “That's pretty impressive.”Ayub said 2,400 people are still under mandatory evacuation orders, mostly south of Lake Sherwood.Ventura County officials urged people to apply for Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance and other benefits. The county will offer financial assistance to renters who lost homes in the fires. A family of three that makes $109,000 a year or less would qualify. Thousand Oaks is opening an assistance center Thursday at the city library.“It has been a tough week for our community, with first the Borderline shooting incident and then followed less than 24 hours afterward by the firestorms,” Thousand Oaks Mayor Andrew Fox said. “Tonight’s meeting, however, is about the process of recovery.”Ventura County health officer Robert Levin warned about poor air quality and other health hazards because of the fires. The county declared a public health emergency Wednesday because of the “potential of widespread toxic exposures and threats.”“The best protection from poor air quality ... is leaving the area,” Levin said. “The next best protection is going indoors, with windows and doors closed.”He said that N95 masks help, but it's better to stay indoors. He also warned people not touch ash, as it could contain toxic chemicals, and recommended that professionals be hired to clean their homes after they return from a mandatory evacuation.Levin also pointed people to the county's website, wellnesseveryday.org, for resources on coping with emotional trauma from the fires.“After a disaster people can feel stress, grief, guilt, anger or depression,” he said. “You do not need to deal with difficult times by yourself.”","dateModified":"2018-11-15T06:25:24.747Z","datePublished":"2018-11-15T05:53:00.000Z","headline":"‘We’ve become a bit of experts on how to recover from fires’: Ventura County town hall starts residents on road back to normal","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a4ff24/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3c%2Fca%2Ffc9d35f92a4d8a883d0e96b4dcee%2Fla-lb-media-afp-getty-us-fire-environment-weather1-20181114-215209","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#weve-become-a-bit-of-experts-on-how-to-recover-from-fires-ventura-county-town-hall-starts-residents-on-road-back-to-normal"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageWhen the Camp fire barreled toward this Sierra foothill town last Thursday morning, officials had a crucial choice to make right way: How much of Paradise should be evacuated?The decision was complicated by history and topography.

Jerry Brown said he was at a loss for words.  “This is so devastating that I don’t really have the words to describe it,” Brown said at a news conference afterward in Chico. “It looks like a war zone. It is.”Brown was by joined by U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, FEMA Administrator Brock Long and state fire officials to give an update on the Camp and Woolsey fires.The governor said he issued an executive order Wednesday that would help “cut red” tape to help speed up Camp fire cleanup and recovery efforts.“We’re in a different kind of world, we know that,” Brown said. “There are many elements to this, what causes these kind of catastrophes.”Brown said that President Trump called him Wednesday. He said the president “pledged the full resources of the federal government.”“I can tell you that California stands in the same position. We do have the funds. We will help out in every way we can, realizing that we have issues in Southern California and we will have problems in the years to come,” Brown said. “Now is the time for solidarity and understanding and let’s learn how to do this together in the best way we can.”Cal Fire Chief Ken Pimlott said dry fire conditions continued to persist across California, which can produce “new and potentially damaging” fires going forward.Zinke said officials were still in the recovery stage while continuing to fight the Camp and Woolsey fires. The next set of challenges, he said, will be protecting against mudslides when the rainy season arrives.  Zinke suggested that California should manage its forests better in the long term in order to prevent large-scale fires that have devastated California communities in recent years. “Maybe we should manage our forests a little more,” he said. Moments later, Zinke said: “There’s loss of life and now people are in shock because they lost their homes and lost their lives. This is unacceptable.”Higher temperatures and longer seasons have led to drier brush, which fuels fires, Zinke said, adding that that’s led to less manpower to do prescribed burns in areas populated with dry brush.“We have dead and dying timber in enormous amounts,” he said. “We don’t have the manpower to do prescribed burns.”Last week, Trump was criticized by firefighters across California when he erroneously blamed deadly and destructive wildfires on poor “forest management.” He said that if the state did not do something about it, the federal government would deny unspecified “payments.”Neither the Woolsey or Camp fires were forest fires, and experts said forest thinning would not have stopped the Camp or the Tubbs fire that last year devastated California’s wine country.Director of the California Office of Emergency Services, Mark Ghilarducci, said the next phase of the recovery process will be getting people who lost their homes into interim housing.Officials are working with Airbnb and are considering bringing in mobile homes since there’s a limited number of available rental properties. The goal, Ghilarducci said, is to house as many people in the area as possible.But the future of Paradise and other small neighboring communities remains unclear.Long warned that rebuilding will take years.Authorities remain focused on identifying the remains of those who perished in the fire. Officials are unsure how long that will take. “There’s sensitivity around debris. We can’t remove it because we are still looking for missing people,” Long said.Since the entire infrastructure of Paradise and neighboring communities was leveled by the Camp fire, residents will need to work alongside local and state officials to envision what the future of these places will look like. “We are striving for a new normal. We need to figure out what is the goal and vision for the community as a result of going through this event,\" Long said.“We will not be able to rebuild Paradise the way it was.”  ","dateModified":"2018-11-15T14:25:31.830Z","datePublished":"2018-11-15T00:20:00.000Z","headline":"Gov.

About 7 or 8 p.m., she thinks, she saw them coming from the Skyway down the hill toward her and her father’s 2.5-acre property, in the 2700 block of Eskin Maidu Trail.“I get why they turned off the power, to prevent more power lines from sparking and stuff, but it would have been nice to be able to watch the news and hear what was going on,” said Anna, 25.Nobody drove by with evacuation orders, she said. She and her father didn’t have a landline, and they didn’t get cell service in the canyon. Anna and her father prepared to flee with their two dogs as quickly as possible, their house soon overtaken by flames. As they were ready to pull out, she said, he ran back in the house.“I don’t know why he went back in the house. We had the dogs, we had everything … and he went back in for some reason, and I was yelling at him not to. I went to the car, honked the horn. He hadn’t came out so I … started the car to start to drive out but the tires had melted,” Anna said.“The house was on fire, the kitchen collapsed and at that point I got the dogs out of the car,” Anna said.Unable to drive away, she ran to a neighbor’s large gravel driveway and found a wet ditch that she used to wet her jacket and hair. She sat there all night with the two dogs, watching for flames and flying embers.She watched the house she had lived in her entire life burn to the ground. She assumes her father was still inside.“I was watching the fire from every direction,” she said. Sometimes, flames were just feet away.“My face was peeling. It still is, because it was so hot. It feels like a really bad sunburn,” she said.“I tried calling 911 once and … they said they’d send someone up to get me that night but no one made it up until the next day,” Anna said. She heard trees falling and didn’t have a flashlight, so she didn’t want to try to escape on foot when it was dark.Once daylight returned, she said, “me and the dogs walked down to the road to meet Cal Fire where they were cutting down trees.”Firefighters gave Anna and the dogs food and water, and drove them to the nearest Red Cross shelter, she said.“It was incredible how much it looked like an inferno around us.”She still feels like she’s in shock, and is coughing from being out in the fire all night. She hasn’t seen a doctor yet, Anna said.Now Anna is staying with family friends in Durham, another town in Butte County, where she feels safe and loved. But most photos she has of her father burned in the fire, along with the books she normally would read to make herself feel less overwhelmed.Authorities still have not confirmed that Gordon died in the fire, she said.Even though she saw what happened, the confirmation would help “to know there isn’t a small percent chance” that her father is alive, she said.Wednesday night will be especially hard, Anna said. Usually she and her dad would be at home watching their favorite show together — “Survivor.”","dateModified":"2018-11-15T06:00:29.670Z","datePublished":"2018-11-14T23:27:00.000Z","headline":"Her father ran back into the house during the Camp fire.

When she was 5, a fire destroyed her home.“This time, we just got out with the clothes on our back,” she said. She escaped, driving through flames on each side of the road. Burning trees created balls of fire around her.“I kept thinking I was going to pass out,” Whitaker said. “I thought that was it.”  Whitaker had been at the impromptu tent city created by evacuees since Friday. It felt like family until Tuesday.“Yesterday, it became scary,” she said.Some people were selling drugs out of a car, she said, and others were complaining that items were going missing from their tents.“I love Paradise,” she said. “If it were safe to be there, I’d be there, on the property, pitch on a tent right now.”Just then, a man named Sean Wright walked up with a plastic bag full of items from Walmart. Wright bought about $30 worth of toiletries — and some toys — for the people staying at the tent city.“Anybody got a couple boys?” he asked, then handed Whitaker a pack of Hot Wheels toy cars. “This is all I can do.”“I’m hoping I can put a smile on your kids’ face,” Wright said. His daughter, who is 8 1/2 months pregnant, lost her home in the fire. Wright said she had just gotten a crib for the new baby.Matthew Flanagan, 55, ran an antiques booth in Paradise. He set up camp with about five other tents in a half-moon shape. In the center were chairs set in a circle. A 45-gallon plastic bin was being used as a table. A puppy named Nell lay nearby, snug in a pink sweater.A woman walked up to Flanagan and gave him a $25 gift card to Walmart.“I might give it to someone else who needs it,” he said.Flanagan and Daryl Merritt met at the camp and realized they lived a block away from each other in Paradise. On Tuesday night, the men tried to think of names for the tent city.“This is Wal-E Hood right here,” Merritt said.Denise Chester, 44, placed donated toys on a yellow blanket while children ran around, playing. Chester, of Magalia, and her husband evacuated their home with their two children, ages 13 and 11. She reminded her children to keep checking in with her as they roamed the camp. Meanwhile, she organized a pile of crayons, markers, coloring books, playing cards, blankets and stuffed animals.“I don’t know my situation yet,” she said. “I don’t want to know.”","dateModified":"2018-11-15T14:35:12.830Z","datePublished":"2018-11-14T22:42:00.000Z","headline":"Evacuees encounter fear and kindness at Chico’s unofficial tent city","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/59b25bd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff9%2F52%2F8ffd0336b7c8102e027da6d4477c%2Fla-lb-media-3065172-me-1113-campfire-mwy-0202-20181115-062349","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#evacuees-encounter-fear-and-kindness-at-chicos-unofficial-tent-city"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe Camp fire — the deadliest wildfire in California history, with at least 48 dead and hundreds missing — haphazardly visited the buildings in Paradise.The town’s high school is still standing, physically, though its fate remains uncertain now that up to 90% of its students have lost their homes in the fire.The low-slung campus, with its green-and-white buildings situated among the pine trees, was unscathed in the fire. Gray smoke filled the air around it Wednesday afternoon, and power lines dangled over sidewalks.The trees on campus were just starting to turn red and yellow for autumn. A charred hillside and the slightly darkened exterior walls of a few buildings on the south side of campus show how close the flames got.Just across Maxwell Drive next to the school, several single-family homes were reduced to ash. A brick fireplace stands sentry at one, hulking above twisted metal and piles of stone that used to be a house. In the driveway is the husk of a long-bed truck with hubcaps whose metal had melted into silver puddles.The First Assembly of God church next to the school is now a brick shell.

Crews are building containment lines by clearing areas along the road of fuels that could ignite if the fire creeps closer to the road.One area of concern is a section of Malibu Canyon Road. Because the road goes through a tunnel, burned material can roll straight to the bottom of the canyon. Firefighters in helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft are “constantly” dropping retardant on the hillside above the tunnel, Anthony said, and firefighters are expected to reach the area above the tunnel on foot to clear the hillside and build a containment line to prevent flammable material from rolling down the hill.Winds are expected to be strong in the morning but should weaken by the evening, somewhat lessening fire-weather concerns, according to the National Weather Service. A red-flag warning remains in effect for the area through 5 p.m. Wednesday with relative humidity in the single digits and lingering Santa Ana winds expected to gust around 35 mph through the morning and early afternoon, said Rich Thompson, a meteorologist with the weather service.That means fire danger remains high but the outlook is improving.As the Santa Ana winds die down in the afternoon, a weak sea breeze could blow wind up the canyons in lower elevations, meaning firefighters could face “battling winds” at some elevations, Thompson said.Another round of weak northeast winds will return overnight into Thursday, gusting around 25 mph, he said.The break in winds will help firefighters keep the blaze from spreading farther west beyond Big Sycamore Canyon Road, where the blaze grew overnight.

The lawsuit seeks compensation for the plaintiffs' losses and unspecified damages.An email to PG&E was not immediately returned.Officials have not determined the cause of the Camp fire.PG&E told state regulators last week that it experienced a problem on a transmission line in the area of the fire just before the blaze erupted.

It said a subsequent aerial inspection detected damage to a transmission tower on the line.Betsy Ann Cowley, a landowner near where the blaze began, said PG&E notified her the day before the blaze that crews needed to come onto her property because the utility's wires were sparking.PG&E President Geisha Williams told the Chico Enterprise-Record on Tuesday that it was too soon to determine if sparks from a transmission line ignited the fire.She said the sparks are one of several options investigators are reviewing.The fire has charred about 200 square miles, but officials said crews were able to keep it from advancing toward Oroville, a town of about 19,000 people.

During a special meeting Tuesday evening, the council unanimously voted to approve the declaration and to return within 30 days to determine whether it needs to be continued.“Given that the city is still experiencing fires within the jurisdiction and that we’re at the beginning of recovery, staff believes the emergency still exists,” City Atty. Tracy Noonan said at the meeting.The Woolsey fire began in the Simi Hills northeast of Thousand Oaks, but fierce winds spread it to various parts of the city and eventually far beyond to Malibu.At one point last week, 75% of Thousand Oaks residents were evacuated. Though all evacuation orders in the city have since been lifted, the Woolsey fire continues to spread and is only 35% contained as of Tuesday.People filtering into the meeting asked one another about evacuations and where they slept after they fled from fires. They traded news about fires still popping up amid the dry conditions. One man said four houses on his street burned down, but his home was safe.At the beginning of the meeting, Mayor Andrew Fox also asked that every one take a moment to remember the the victims of the Borderline shooting, in which 12 people were gunned down in a bar in the city last week.

They don’t talk, but she did want to know he was OK. She and other family members have been following Facebook posts on him.Butler is from the tiny town of Concow, Calif., population 710, and was staying at her mom’s house in Oroville on Tuesday with her two young daughters, Novalei, 5, and Aurora, 2. Butler and her husband and girls lived in a 2-bedroom modular house with a big wraparound deck and a beautiful yard on Big Bend Road, where they’d moved about a year ago. They had just built a huge chicken coop. They were renting but planned to buy the house in March, she said. On Thursday, when the Camp fire started, Megan took Novalei to Concow Elementary School, where she had just started Kindergarten. When they got there, the school had no power and staff told her it was being evacuated. Smoke filled the air. From the school, she could tell that the Concow property where her uncle and grandmother lived on Jordan Hill Road was probably in the path of the fire. “From the school, I could tell the fire was there at their house,” she said. “I know the mountain. So I was freaking out. I was like, I need to go over there, but I have my 5-year-old with me.” She couldn't get a hold of her grandma, and though she wanted to stop by, she knew she couldn’t with her daughter being with her. So, they went home and packed. Novalei grabbed clothes. Aurora started putting baby doll toys in trash bags. They drove out even though they hadn’t gotten evacuation orders.On Friday afternoon, she went up with relatives in a four-wheel-drive vehicle to see her house.It’s gone. Parts of it were still aflame.Her grandmother’s house is gone, too. Megan’s family has lived in Concow, an unincorporated mountain community, for generations. Both her mom and grandma went to Concow Elementary. She grew up in her grandma’s house — the kind of place where she always felt welcome and had lived many times when she was trying to find places to rent. “I don't think I’m going to get to go back to Concow,” she said.“There’s nothing up there for me right now.” She paused, taking a breath.“This is really starting to upset me. I was close to my grandma’s house more than mine. I hadn’t lived there that long. But my grandma’s has been there my entire life. Right there. All my dogs are buried there. It’s everything. My kids had rooms there. It just really sucks.”Megan said she was sad and angry that the fate of the small towns in the area seems to have been forgotten amid the devastation in Paradise. “It feels like we are being ignored. Completely ignored. Maybe it’s just a lot of confused people or maybe because we're so close to Paradise they consider it all the same,” she said. “But it’s Concow. It’s my home. It’s my community. When you’re in Concow, everybody smiles and waves whether you know them or not.” On social media, she said, some residents are saying they’re going to rebuild. Others are frustrated they aren’t hearing more about the town in the news. Some think the worst — that firefighters let it burn because Paradise was the bigger concern. Butler said she and her husband have disagreed about whether to rebuild. He wants to. She doesn’t. It wouldn’t be a good environment for the girls, she said, starting over from that kind of devastation.Novalei, she said, has been crying for days. She wants to go home.","dateModified":"2018-11-14T00:28:35.710Z","datePublished":"2018-11-13T23:57:00.000Z","headline":"In the shadow of Paradise devastation, some small-town residents feel forgotten","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b02f1f8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb5%2F28%2F883716f9a6390e2a990ea949b063%2Fla-lb-media-3065155-me-1113-campfire-08-cmc-20181113-150940","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#in-the-shadow-of-paradise-devastation-some-small-town-residents-feel-forgotten"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageAll that remains of the the Peter Strauss Ranch — once a magnificent symbol of the West — is charred remnants.The ranch once had a swimming pool and amphitheater and featured performances by country stars Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson. The Woolsey fire left behind a white central chimney and stone walls.

That could lead to increased bacteria in the water, officials said.  The emergency declaration approved Tuesday will allow staff to obtain necessary equipment and hire contractors to repair critical water and wastewater facilities damaged by the fire.The district is also waiving water and wastewater charges for the billing period during which a home was destroyed or rendered uninhabitable because of the fire, and it reduced bills for customers who used more water to protect their properties.","dateModified":"2018-11-13T21:31:17.228Z","datePublished":"2018-11-13T21:10:00.000Z","headline":"Las Virgenes water district declares state of emergency, reduces bills in Woolsey fire area","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e09a5b6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x720+0+67/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2Fb3%2Fbeec1576fc6e8fac7965c0afea44%2Fla-lb-media-download2-20181113-124932","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Alejandra Reyes-Velarde"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#las-virgenes-water-district-declares-state-of-emergency-reduces-bills-in-woolsey-fire-area"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThanksgiving break came early for thousands of students in California, but the days off were no cause for celebration.

They flew back Monday to see what was left of their street in the Oak Forest Mobile Estates in Westlake Village.Home after home in Bailey’s pocket in the canyon was leveled.“This street just got annihilated,” Bailey said.Bailey and Carr’s home was a pile of rubble, with charred appliances, some mattresses and the blackened metal frames of a couch and patio chair.“Well, the yard’s bigger now,” Carr joked, standing above the exposed steel beams of the soot-covered foundation.Bailey rummaged through the remnants and found an ashy metal case that once held colored pencils, along with a ceramic piggy bank. Burned pages of a “Harry Potter” book were scattered about.But so much more had been lost.Carr, a lifeguard, lost his collection of vintage surfboards, which were melted into a pile of fiberglass. His truck was a burned-out husk of metal. Six bikes and his scuba gear were all gone.For Bailey, it was the love letters to Carr, a man she has known since she was 13 and with whom she reconnected later in life. The letters were now gone, along with the rest of the house.It was a neighborhood with young families in their first homes. In a region populated by celebrities and business titans, this pocket of mobile homes was middle class.Bailey said she has been humbled these last few days. The bartender at their hotel last night recounted how his partner recently had a heart attack. In Mexico, people spoke of the hurricane’s devastation.“It’s humbling to take a step back. This pain is real, but other people experience pain too — it’s part of life,” she said.While in Mexico, the couple waited anxiously for updates on the fire. Bailey checked her Nest camera, but the service dropped before any fire was visible. She watched TV helicopter cameras showing the ridge of homes above her neighborhood. Finally she found a video on Twitter showing her house in flames, the truck burning in the carport.On Tuesday, she and Carr saw the destruction in person for the first time.They moved into the home in February and initially struggled to get fire insurance. They loved the neighborhood, a secluded cluster of homes in a canyon ensconced by dozens of oak trees, giving shade and privacy.“It was the most magical street — so much shade. The treehouse was right here,” Bailey said, pointing to a charred oak.“I’m sorry,” Carr said, apologizing for having not been there to save the house. “I loved this house.”Bailey comforted him, telling him: “There’s nothing you could have done.”“We’ll rebuild,” she said. “We’ll do it again.”","dateModified":"2018-11-14T01:06:38.342Z","datePublished":"2018-11-13T20:06:00.000Z","headline":"‘This street just got annihilated’: Residents return to Westlake Village to find homes in charred ruins","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d278f91/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2F41%2F5b468ea5b06b2d37f4ce9c194de7%2Fla-lb-media-3065091-me-woolsey-fire-1-als-20181113-114731","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#this-street-just-got-annihilated-residents-return-to-westlake-village-to-find-homes-in-charred-ruins"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Video","dateModified":"2018-11-13T20:04:32.160Z","datePublished":"2018-11-13T19:50:00.000Z","headline":"In Malibu, supplies arrive by boat as the Woolsey fire continues to burn","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#in-malibu-supplies-arrive-by-boat-as-the-woolsey-fire-continues-to-burn"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Video","dateModified":"2018-11-13T19:54:38.189Z","datePublished":"2018-11-13T19:45:00.000Z","headline":"Watch as crews fight the Woolsey fire from above Westlake Village","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#watch-as-crews-fight-the-woolsey-fire-from-above-westlake-village"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageLos Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said the Woolsey fire is among the largest blazes on record in the county dating back 100 years.

And its sprawling ranch land has given Hollywood real-world ties to the frontier life it exhaustively depicted on screen.The Woolsey fire destroyed more than 400 structures but also took a deep toll on landmark areas of the mountain areas. Wildfires decimated the historic park tucked inside the Santa Monica Mountains a day earlier — taking with it markers of its proud past as a backdrop for television shows and movies such as “Planet of the Apes.”Flames consumed the set of the long-running TV series “MASH.” The same went for the Reagan Ranch, named after the former president and actor who used to own one of three parcels that comprise the 44-year-old park’s footprint along with Bob Hope and 20th Century Fox. About two miles west saw the destruction of the Peter Strauss Ranch, named after an Emmy Award-winning actor. The ranch featured a swimming pool and amphitheater and was the site of art exhibits and performances by country stars Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson. All that remained of the ranch house was a few stone walls and a chimney. ImagePublic access to the mountain range has been hard fought. It was propelled by the establishment of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy in 1980 by the state. Funded with bond measures and led by an ambitious executive director, Joe Edmiston, the agency has preserved tens of thousands of acres of land along the range.The powerful group has also advocated against too much residential development. Last year, Edmiston called for the limiting of recovery funds for rebuilding homes in fire-prone areas.

McGrath encouraged residents to stay away. The Ventura County Sheriff’s Department said mandatory evacuations remain in effect south of Potrero Road for communities in the Lake Sherwood and Hidden Valley area. The spot fire started about 9:15 a.m. Tuesday and had grown to more than 50 acres in less than an hour’s time, according to Cal Fire.10:20 a.m.: This article was updated with information about mandatory evacuations.10:08 a.m.: This article was updated with information from a Cal Fire spokesman.This article was originally published at 9:40 a.m. ","dateModified":"2018-11-13T20:06:39.921Z","datePublished":"2018-11-13T18:20:00.000Z","headline":"Mandatory evacuations remain in place for Lake Sherwood, Hidden Valley area as spot fire flares up","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0821fcf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+148/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F37%2F72%2F626145dc98a6836baf2f12494980%2Fla-lb-media-10756073504-ik13362-20181113-091924","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Melissa Etehad"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#mandatory-evacuations-remain-in-place-for-lake-sherwood-hidden-valley-area-as-spot-fire-flares-up"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImagePresident Trump approved a disaster declaration for California, making federal funding available for the recovery efforts of Butte, Los Angeles and Ventura counties after the disastrous Camp and Woolsey fires scorched hundreds of homes. The Camp fire destroyed the town of Paradise in Butte County, burning through 125,000 acres and  more than 6,500 homes, according to Cal Fire.

He sprayed the bushes 20, sometimes 30 times. He used the hoses to drench the grove of eggplants, the barn and the shed that had hundreds of thousands of dollars in power tools. He sprayed down the rows of pine and oak trees in his corner of paradise, the fruits of a career as an engineer with Los Angeles County's public works department.His five-bedroom home sits at the top of a hill, so Zadeh knew it was key to soak the hillsides, the pine trees and the holly trees around his 10-acre property, not wanting to give the embers any fuel to sustain their burn.\"The wind was carrying and embers were flying everywhere,\" Zadeh said. Every few minutes, he drenched his head, face and clothes with water, so as not to get burned by a stray ember.At one point, the smoke was so bad that he could see only 2 feet in front of him. The heat was stronger than a sauna, pushing 140 degrees. Propane tanks began exploding on the farm, like small bombs shaking the compound.\"The heat was so enormous, so smoky, it was like a monster was coming,\" he said.In all of this, he was alone. His wife fled with their pets. His son was stuck along the shore in Malibu, blocked from returning home.\"The Fire Department — they saw me, looked at me and just kept through,\" he said. He guessed that firetrucks drove by about 50 times while he mounted his defense. \"Close to six hours I was here. Those guys … nothing.\"I'm not saying they could stop all the flames,\" he said. \"But they could help.\"The exact tactics of the firefighters was unclear. But officials have said the Woolsey fire was so powerful that firefighters had to make tough choices about how to use their limited resources.\"We can't put a fire engine in every driveway,\" Rich Macklin, a spokesman for Ventura County Fire Department, said when asked about how resources were generally allocated. \"But we saved a lot of houses and got a lot of people out.\"An hour into the firefight, with the thick smoke and roaring flames encircling his property, Zadeh's fear peaked.\"I thought, I'm going to die,\" he said. He kept spraying his hose. At one point, he ran in the house to wash his face. He looked in the mirror and couldn't see the whites of his eyes.The only person who ever stopped to talk to him, he said, was an Italian news reporter passing through later in the afternoon. Zadeh asked the reporter for a favor. \"Please tell my wife: I'm alive and I saved the house.\"On Monday, the slopes of his lawn were singed black. The barn was burned out. Trees charred and all but dead.And he and his son have begun to survey the damage.The hay room is destroyed. His 1999 Lexus sedan partly melted.

A man matching that description was also seen driving south on Trancas Canyon Road that afternoon.Bud Robison, property manager at Malibu Bay Club, saw three men on dual sport motorcycles wearing bandannas who were trespassing on the property Sunday afternoon. There were no license plates on the bikes. He said he asked the men for identification and they ignored him.Robison said a door to one of the units was kicked in. Several other condos were already open because firefighters had forced their way in Friday to battle the blaze. The men jumped on their bikes and drove to the other side of the complex and when confronted, Robison said one of them had a pistol.“They weren’t pursuing me and they weren’t aggressive,” he said, “but I felt that if I had followed them they would come after me. I wanted to get an authority right away.”He walked across Pacific Coast Highway and told the police officers stationed at the Ventura County fire station and officers immediately responded. An armed security guard is now at the complex.Robison said about 20 condos have fire or water damage out of about 130 units in the complex.The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has deployed about 500 deputies to patrol evacuated homes in the Woolsey fire burn area to help prevent looting.Suspicious activity should be immediately reported to the Sheriff’s Department, department spokeswoman Nicole Nishida said.The department has not made any arrests in connection with looting.

There they could organize and try to improve their lot and those of others, said his son Dan Wolf, 68. The rabbi built two camps in Malibu: the beach side Hess Kramer and its sister camp Hilltop. In the 1960s, they became another home for a group of young Latinos who helped launch the Chicano movement.On Monday, the camps’ director, Seth Toybes, confirmed that Camp Hilltop was destroyed by the Woolsey fire.At Camp Hess Kramer only a dining hall and a building that housed an infirmary and offices are standing — as well as a wooden Menorah and the plaque that commemorated its founder. Out of 28 cabins, only one survived the fire. The lonely Menorah that sits atop Inspiration Hill serves as a literal and figurative sign that the camp will be rebuilt, and that its spirit of empowerment for young people will live on, said Dan Wolf.Camp Kramer was the place that planted the seed for many Chicano leaders, including Vickie Castro, who attended the first Latino youth conference there in 1963. Castro would later become the second Latino ever elected to the Los Angeles Board of Education.“Camp Kramer gave me a voice,” she said Monday. “It gave me organizational skills, and it exposed me to a much larger world than my own little neighborhood.”It was at camp, she said, that she met young people from all over L.A. County who experienced the same problems in trying to get a good education that she did at Roosevelt High School in Boyle Heights. She played a part in forming the Young Chicanos for Community Action, which would later become the Brown Berets.At the 1967 retreat, Lincoln High School social science teacher Sal Castro began to form the idea for a boycott — the East Los Angeles Blowouts of 1968. At least 10,000 high school students, including Castro, boycotted their schools in protest of widespread racism and inadequate education standards. Castro said the destruction of the camps deeply saddened her.“So many good memories,” she said. “It was a life-changing experience for me.”Dan Wolf said his father wanted the camps to be a beacon for positive change. “My father was directly involved in saying come use our facility to make your plans to make change,” he said. “I’m sure back in those days there were places they couldn’t go.”Since it was built in 1952, the camp has been a haven for generations of children, some coming from abroad and out of state.“There's this connection that develops with that place...and I believe when its rebuilt that connection will continue. That won’t be lost.”Toybes and Wolf said they are already planning to rebuild the structures and will host camp in a rented space until construction is complete. “We’re going to have camp this summer, no matter what,” said Toybes.  Tweet Image","dateModified":"2018-11-13T02:00:58.208Z","datePublished":"2018-11-13T01:32:00.000Z","headline":"Camp Hess Kramer and Camp Hilltop helped give life to the Chicano movement of the ‘60s.

But that doesn’t mean you can breathe easy.Property insurance lawyers say it’s not uncommon for insurers to do everything possible to minimize payouts, especially after catastrophic blazes such as the ones now raging in Northern and Southern California.Some policies may require homeowners to report any such damage within 90 days to qualify for coverage. Others may cap coverage at a certain level, frequently $5,000.Such provisions often are inserted into policies during routine renewals. Although all changes must be disclosed, many homeowners may not pay attention or may not read the fine print.Then there’s the matter of whether the coverage you’ve purchased is sufficient to accommodate increases in material and labor costs. Experts say underinsurance is one of the most common issues as homeowners try to recover and rebuild after a huge fire.Amy Bach, executive director of the advocacy group United Policyholders, said her organization estimates that as many as two-thirds of California homeowners may not have enough coverage for a catastrophic fire.“Chances are, you’ll be short,” she said.Bach advised all homeowners to contact their insurance company and arrange for a policy review based on the latest information about fire risk.Read more","dateModified":"2018-11-12T23:48:18.005Z","datePublished":"2018-11-12T23:23:00.000Z","headline":"What to do when dealing with an insurer after your home catches fire","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3f2af8d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc3%2F54%2F0fc5d24cd88f4ec0e07d416054e8%2Fla-lb-media-3064976-me-1111-campfire-06-cmc-20181112-151925","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"David Lazarus"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#what-to-do-when-dealing-with-an-insurer-after-your-home-catches-fire"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe husky in the online photo had burned ears and a brown spot on her forehead where the fire had singed her fur. But one look at the expression on her face, and Wade Lovett knew he had found his dog.“She had this pout, and that's her face. As soon as I saw that, I said, ‘That's Luna,’ ” Lovett said. “She’s a beautiful dog, but when she pouts, she pouts.”He had last seen her two days earlier, as he packed his neighbor’s truck and prepared to leave Paradise, the town he’s lived in his whole life, as the Camp fire barreled toward him. Luna was perched in the front seat and after somehow rolling the window down with her paw, she bolted. Lovett followed her by truck and by foot for nearly an hour, until the flames got too close.Lovett, 44, traveled to Chico, picking up nine others along the way during the three-hour drive for a distance that usually takes around 20 minutes. He and his father, another Paradise resident, put up at his aunt and uncle’s house and waited word on the fate of the town his family helped settle in the 19th century.Luna had made her way to Chico as well. Nicole Clift, who had been volunteering at the Elk’s Lodge, found the dog standing with three young men who explained the animal had run onto the bus that was transporting evacuees from Paradise. Clift, herself a dog owner, decided her family would foster the pup until her owner could be found.The dog had a collar, but no tags and no chip to identify to whom she belonged. And the tales of devastation coming out of Paradise made the prospect of finding Luna’s owner even more remote. When Clift told a veterinary tech who helped treat Luna’s burned ears and cut paw about the search, the tech teared up.“She said, ‘You do understand she may not have an owner to come back to?’ ” Clift recalled. “I told her, ‘Yes I understand.’ ”Clift, who works at Chico State, said her family was prepared to keep Luna if no one claimed her. But first, her family mounted a social media campaign. Her post about Luna was shared 2,700 times. Others, including a Times reporter and actor James Woods, shared the photo on Twitter, garnering thousands of retweets.Aided by his more tech-savvy aunt, Lovett found Clift’s post by Saturday night. Over the phone, Clift quizzed him on one detail she had deliberately omitted from her post: What was written on Luna’s red collar. “Service animal,” Lovett said correctly. Clift brought his dog over that night.“We were ecstatic,” Clift said. “I was anticipating a lot of different endings, but this one was the best.”Lovett plans on staying in Chico for the time being.

Few, however, may have felt the fire’s destructive power more than Mark Bakalor.On Thursday night, not long after the fire first roared to life, Bakalor and his family fled their Oak Park house as the flames approached.Bakalor then turned his attention to his parents, who had lived for years in a house on Lobo Canyon Road in Agoura Hills, and to his in-laws, who lived in Bell Canyon. For Bakalor, both houses were too close to the fire, which was spreading quickly and in several directions at once. Image“I called my parents and said, ‘Look, it’s about to jump the freeway and heading your way. I need you to pack your photo albums and leave.’”His in-laws had already left their house, but told Bakalor on the phone that they were intent on returning. It was more than just a house to the couple: Bakalor’s father-in-law is Mike Garson, a pianist who had played for decades with David Bowie as well as many other famous musicians. Instruments, equipment, memorabilia and decades of memories were in a recording studio on the property.Bakalor urged Garson and his wife to stay away. The couple reluctantly agreed.The following night, Bakalor was in the car, returning from a shopping run for toothbrushes, clothes for his child, and other necessities they had fled without packing, when his phone rang.“It’s gone,” his mother said. “The house is gone.”“How do you know?” he asked.“We’re watching it burn on TV.”It had been the couple’s dream house — an 11,300-square-foot modern mansion built nearly 20 years earlier on more than 20 acres nestled in the Santa Monica Mountains. There was an 18-seat movie theater and a library.But the Woolsey fire wasn’t done with Bakalor’s family yet.Less than an hour later, a news helicopter trained its camera on Bell Canyon. It zoomed in on Hitching Post Lane. His in-laws’ street.A creeping disbelief settled in as he watched with his brother-in-law. The camera panned to the smoldering remains of a house with a pool and hot tub. Only the chimney remained.  Bakalor knew that chimney. He knew that pool.It looked as if the walls of the studio were still standing, but flames were everywhere. When a Los Angeles Times reporter visited the house Sunday, those walls were gone. The charred, flattened husk of a piano was visible from the driveway. A blackened mess of tangled piano wires marked the floor, near what appeared to have been a speaker.------------FOR THE RECORD3:40 p.m.: An earlier version of this article misspelled Mark Bakalor’s last name as Bankalor and Banklor.------------","dateModified":"2018-11-13T00:52:34.966Z","datePublished":"2018-11-12T23:00:00.000Z","headline":"A family watched their homes burn on TV, one after another","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/47bcf84/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x675+0+463/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F5d%2Fad95396e964c00ad25da7bdeb178%2F900","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Joel Rubin"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#a-family-watched-their-homes-burn-on-tv-one-after-another"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe two badly burned bodies found at 33133 Mulholland Highway late Friday afternoon appear to be victims of the fast-moving Woolsey fire, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Homicide Bureau Sgt. Guillermo Morales.“We do not think they were residents of that location; those people have been accounted for,” Morales said. “We think they were trying to evacuate, and we kind of know who they might be, but we’re waiting for the coroner to do the identification.”The bodies were found in the driver’s and front passenger seats of a charred SUV that had been burned so badly investigators couldn’t see its markings, Morales said. Investigators think the driver got disoriented in the fire and turned in the driveway, thinking it was a roadway, while trying to escape.“This is not your normal driveway,” Morales said. “It’s probably a half-mile long and windy, so it looks like a small road. They were burned, the house was burned. … The whole landscape around there is burned to a crisp. The visibility was probably zero, and we think they were overcome by the flames.”Although investigators think the deaths were caused by the fire, they are treating the case as a possible homicide until the cause of the Woolsey fire is determined, Morales said. “If it’s deemed an arson, then this is a homicide investigation.”Investigators were notified about the bodies late Friday afternoon, but the area was so hot, they weren’t able to reach the location until Saturday.On Monday, the remnants of two cars were visible about a third of a mile up a long, curving driveway, beyond an electronic gate that had been left open. Scattered across the pavement were a few fragments: screws, broken glass, pools of melted metal. A softened windshield was draped over the cliffside.One car had apparently burned with such intensity that the license plate left an impression of its digits stamped on the asphalt.","dateModified":"2018-11-12T23:25:48.101Z","datePublished":"2018-11-12T22:45:00.000Z","headline":"Two found dead in Malibu car may have gotten confused fleeing from Woolsey fire, authorities say","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bfdfcd0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1080+0+100/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa8%2F08%2Fb218d5fc6147e7a867412cb01bca%2Fla-lb-media-3065000-me-woolsey-fire008-als-20181112-141158","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Jeanette Marantos"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Laura J.

Authorities ordered immediate evacuations for residents in the areas of Box Canyon and Lake Manor, south of the 118 in an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County.  TweetThe Ventura County Fire Department sent strike teams and aircraft to the Peak fire as Metrolink traffic was stopped in the area, said Capt. Stan Ziegler. Officials initially closed the 118 in both directions between Yosemite Avenue to Topanga Canyon Boulevard, but reopened the 118 west by 12:30 p.m. The California Highway Patrol said Box Canyon Road was closed at the Los Angeles County line, and Santa Susana Pass Road was closed between Topanga Canyon Boulevard and Simi Valley. Ziegler said those in the area of the fire had been asked to shelter in place on Kuehner Drive in Simi Valley.  TweetMeanwhile, authorities said the threat to nearby homes caused by the Lynn fire, which broke out in the Lynn Ranch area of Thousand Oaks, was gone late Monday morning as firefighters tackled it from the air and the ground. Ziegler said the fire was holding at less than 5 acres.Ziegler said it’s undetermined whether that fire is connected to the nearby Hill or Woolsey fires. He encouraged residents to stay aware of their surroundings. High winds and red flag warnings are in effect through Tuesday afternoon in Southern California. Tweet“As you can see, the very slightest spark can start another fire,” he said in a video posted to Twitter. The video showed Ziegler moving through charred ground under a hazy and smoke-filled sky. High winds made the video difficult to understand at times. Fire crews could be seen stomping through the brush in the distance. Air tankers had just dropped retardant, and he said helicopters were on the way to drop water on the area. Ziegler said the Fire Department keeps additional resources at the ready during red flag warnings to respond to flare-ups and knock down fires quickly. “The timing was perfect to slow this fire down,” he said.12:55 p.m.: This article was updated with new acreage and the reopening of parts of the freeway.12:31 p.m.: This article was updated with acreage numbers and evacuations for the Peak fire.This article was originally published at 12:02 p.m.","dateModified":"2018-11-12T21:33:23.144Z","datePublished":"2018-11-12T20:55:00.000Z","headline":"Two new fires break out in Ventura County","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c5546bf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1874x1054+16+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F72%2Ffb%2Fefdc93bcdb135b234fdbc8a4998b%2Fla-lb-media-la-me-rocky-peak-fire02-20181112-121452","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Andrea Castillo"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#two-new-fires-break-out-in-ventura-county"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Video","dateModified":"2018-11-12T21:02:33.321Z","datePublished":"2018-11-12T20:53:00.000Z","headline":"Video: In Butte County, an eerie aftermath settles over areas scorched by the Camp fire","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#video-in-butte-county-an-eerie-aftermath-settles-over-areas-scorched-by-the-camp-fire"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageStocks of California’s two largest utility owners, PG&E Corp. and Edison International, plummeted again Monday as investors feared that the deadly wildfires raging in the state could leave the utilities with massive liabilities.It was the stocks’ worst drubbing since the California power crisis more than 15 years ago.Read the full story here.","dateModified":"2018-11-12T20:57:31.577Z","datePublished":"2018-11-12T20:25:00.000Z","headline":"PG&E and Edison stocks plummet as California wildfires burn","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2e6a60d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1399x787+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F36%2F92%2Ff09f4054b6641b4591a87693923e%2Fla-1542042686-edbdoypsgd-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"James F.

Solar panels glinted from scorched hillsides.The silence was punctuated by the beep-beep-beep of utility trucks, the whir of helicopters dropping water and the roar of the wind blowing ash and dust across the hills.Piles of white ash mixed with blackened earth and made the soil appear silver in places.The shoulder of Mulholland Highway was filled with trash, burned palm fronds and the remnants of people’s homes: a New Yorker subscription card, a page from a 1977 yearbook, a half-melted parking ticket for going 101 mph in a 60-mph zone.Along the 33000 block of Mulholland Highway, the area where two bodies were found Friday afternoon “severely burned inside of a stopped vehicle,” one home’s long, winding driveway led past an outbuilding and a BMW that looked untouched, but ended at a crumpled garage with two cars that had incinerated inside.

We knew how detrimental it would be if they were both separated,” she said. ","dateModified":"2018-11-12T20:04:15.726Z","datePublished":"2018-11-12T19:58:00.000Z","headline":"Donations pour in from across the country to help 600 displaced animals","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/08a677f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+104/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0b%2F6d%2Fb8e02adb453b76db8ad0b52fea1c%2Fla-lb-media-3064896-me-1109-woolsey-fire-012-gem-20181112-115525","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Melissa Etehad"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#donations-pour-in-from-across-the-country-to-help-600-displaced-animals"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageAs the deadly Woolsey fire continued to blaze in and around Malibu on Monday, fire officials carried on with aggressive air attacks to quench the burning flames that did not discriminate among properties.The fire burned 91,572 acres and charred 370 structures in Los Angeles and Ventura counties and was 20% contained as of Monday morning, according to California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection officials.By Sunday, the destructive fire had already claimed two lives and forced 250,000 people to flee their homes from Malibu to Thousand Oaks.

There are some areas with some thinned-out forests, however, most of it is really heavy,” said Jonathan Pangburn, a fire behavior analyst with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.The landscape’s susceptibility to fire can’t be understated, officials said.Three times Sunday night the blaze “jumped” a 300-foot lake thanks to red-hot embers that landed on some parched grass and triggered another fire, Pangburn said.“Areas where you’d expect the fire to not necessarily continue forward in previous years, the fuels are just too dry,” he said.The fire grew overnight, with officials saying it had burned 113,000 acres and was 25% contained as of Monday morning. Most of that spread was on the blaze’s northeastern flank toward Sterling City and deeper into the Sierra Nevada and to the southeast, where it jumped the Feather River.The fire has killed at least 29 people and destroyed 6,700 homes and businesses. The search for additional victims in the the ruins of the Sierra foothills town of Paradise continues.","dateModified":"2018-11-12T17:29:43.055Z","datePublished":"2018-11-12T16:53:00.000Z","headline":"Red-flag warning expiring in Butte County as containment grows in deadly Camp fire","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3af524e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2044x1150+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb4%2Fd6%2F250690129ef81ef60f937c8c7c32%2Fla-1541993827-nufnw89zvc-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Joseph Serna"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#red-flag-warning-expiring-in-butte-county-as-containment-grows-in-deadly-camp-fire"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThere are two major destructive fires still largely uncontained and raging in California. Classes have been canceled in affected areas, and thousands of families have been displaced.It’s important to know how to talk to children about that trauma. Here is some advice from experts collected in the wake of the fires that hit Northern California last fall:Answer their questions and validate their feelingsKids might ask questions that parents don’t want to answer. But parents shouldn’t ignore or dismiss those questions. Saying everything is fine when it’s clearly not invalidates children’s feelings and can affect them negatively, said Jennifer MacLeamy, who at the time was the director of behavioral health at the Petaluma Health Center.“The thing that children want the most is to know that their parents are in control and taking care of them,” MacLeamy said. “What happens in a natural disaster is exactly the opposite … so they’re feeling that fear and that uncertainty. So we have to validate that feeling.”Try different approaches to figure out what they’re feelingThere are different ways to figure out how kids are feeling and what they’re experiencing, if doing so directly isn’t working. Parents can ask them what they’ve heard or try art-based therapy, said Marian Pena, the behavioral health director at West County Health Centers in Sonoma County, where more than 20 people were killed in fires last year. Sometimes children don't have the words but stress come out in what they draw.MacLeamy suggests asking what they are dreaming about, or what they and their friends are telling them.Keep routines in place, but add hugsDuring the Northern California fires, parents often asked “how to be with their children so much when they’re not at school and experiencing all this trauma and distress,” MacLeamy said.Schools may be closed for days or weeks during fires or after a massive earthquake. Children (and adults) feel safer doing what they usually do, so it’s important to maintain some elements of their daily routine, like eating and sleeping at normal times, mental health experts said.“Rituals and routines and boundaries are how children really know for sure that they’re safe,” MacLeamy said. That’s how “kids know that, even though a lot of things in their world have changed, not everything has changed.”But it’s also good to add some extra affection to those routines — hugs, a bedtime snuggle, assurances that kids are out of harm’s way.“‘I love you and you’re safe.’ Just keep saying it, over and over again,” MacLeamy said. “A hug is really powerful.”Try to find some hopeIt’s important to acknowledge the bad things that have happened, but parents should try to answer their children’s questions with some hope, MacLeamy said.If children ask about deaths, she said, it’s important to acknowledge the losses but also point out that most people found safety.If an older child is afraid and asks about the deaths, she said, it might help to look at a map together and point out all the places where people were safely rescued or evacuated.It’s also important to let children be part of the community healing process, MacLeamy said.“Children will always remember when they were in a natural disaster. So if we can make that memory … a story of overcoming, rather than just — ‘and then we were depressed and miserable for the next two months,’ it can help shape children’s memories and recovery,” she said. “Kids don’t have a lot of agency in their lives and they really want to help. They want to contribute in some way.”For more, read this guide on how to prepare children for fires and earthquakes, before and after they happen.","dateModified":"2018-11-12T17:12:42.002Z","datePublished":"2018-11-12T16:31:00.000Z","headline":"How to talk to kids about the fires","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/00e045e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+117/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F24%2F08%2F67e9e7a87b7b4c2b1933fd124596%2Fla-lb-media-3064924-me-1110-woolsey-fire8-wjs-20181112-081819","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Sonali Kohli"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#how-to-talk-to-kids-about-the-fires"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe Woolsey fire has charred 91,572 acres in Los Angeles and Ventura counties and was 20% contained as of Monday morning, according to California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection officials. A lack of wind over the weekend allowed firefighters to gain significant ground and put containment lines into place.

Over the coming days, he said, deputies will be working to sort through the confusion.By Sunday evening, the Camp fire — named because it began near Camp Creek Road in Butte County — had charred 111,000 acres and was 25% contained, fire authorities said.Alex Hoon, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said at an evening news conference that the powerful winds that have plagued the fire fight are expected to die down after Monday. ","dateModified":"2018-11-12T15:15:51.478Z","datePublished":"2018-11-12T15:09:00.000Z","headline":"228 people still missing in Paradise as grim search for victims continues","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Joseph Serna"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#228-people-still-missing-in-paradise-as-grim-search-for-victims-continues"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Residents in portions of the Woolsey fire evacuation area have been advised to boil their tap water before drinking it or using it to cook. The boil-water notice was issued Sunday night for Los Angeles County Waterworks District No. 29’s Point Dume and Encinal Canyon service areas and Las Virgenes Municipal Water District customers south of Westlake Village, east of the Ventura County line, north of Malibu and west of Corral Canyon. Officials said customers within the affected areas should either use bottled water or boil tap water for one minute prior to its use for drinking, brushing teeth and cooking. Firefighting efforts caused a significant loss of pressure within the water systems, which could result in increased bacteria in the water, officials said.

It was reported “out of an abundance of caution,” the report said.Steve Conroy, an Edison spokesman, said the utility is required to submit a report to the CPUC “any time there’s any kind of incident that may or may not have anything to do with the event.”“The report is preliminary,” he said. “We have no other information other than a line went out of service and we don’t know why.” A relay occurs when a disturbance is detected in an area and circuits become de-energized, Edison says on its website.“This means an outage remains until it is safe to manually re-energize the circuit. This is not a Public Safety Power Shutoff; it is simply a safety feature to help mitigate wildfire risk.”The same day, PG&E said in an incident report that the utility experienced an outage on a transmission line in Butte County 15 minutes before the Camp fire broke out.“PG&E observed by aerial patrol damage to a transmission tower on the Caribou-Palermo 115 kV Transmission line … in the area of the Camp fire,” the utility said in a report. The Mercury News reported the line outage was in the same area where firefighters discovered downed power lines while responding to the fire. “We’ve got eyes on the vegetation fire. It’s going to be very difficult to access. Camp Creek Road is nearly inaccessible,” one firefighter told dispatch in a radio transmission. “It is on the west side of the river underneath the transmission lines.”Paul Doherty, a spokesman for PG&E, said the report is preliminary and the utility will cooperate with any related investigations.The utility had warned 70,000 of its customers that it may shut off power proactively, but weather conditions did not meet the criteria for a proactive power shutoff, he said. Southern California Edison warned customers Sunday night that it could shut off power between Malibu and La Verne on Monday. Edison previously had notified 74,000 customers in high fire-risk areas of possible shutoffs. Shortly before noon on Monday, Edison shut off power for 50 customers in Moorpark.More than 9,000 Edison customers are without power because of damage the Woolsey fire has done to infrastructure and equipment, according to Lois Pitter Bruce, a spokeswoman for the utility. “Crews are trying to gain access, but due to treacherous conditions, our restoration is not going to be as expedited as we’d like it to be,” she said. According to Edison’s incident report, the utility also has been unable to access its facilities in the area where the fire began. “At this point, we have no indication from fire agency personnel that SCE utility facilities may have been involved in the start of the fire,” the report said. “The investigation into the matter is ongoing.” California wildfires have put pressure on utilities across the state. Shares for Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. and Edison International, the state’s largest utility owners, fell significantly after the fires broke out.------------1:50: This article was updated to include information about PG&E’s incident report.This article was originally published at 11:49 a.m.","dateModified":"2018-11-12T22:25:29.408Z","datePublished":"2018-11-12T09:50:00.000Z","headline":"SoCal Edison and PG&E reported outages near Woolsey and Camp fires minutes before the blazes began","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cd673d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+108/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2Fb6%2F5d2ee4ec35f0011b0fd42420835a%2Fla-lb-media-la-me-sce-wildfire-safety-measures02-20181112-101905","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Alejandra Reyes-Velarde"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#socal-edison-and-pg-e-reported-outages-near-woolsey-and-camp-fires-minutes-before-the-blazes-began"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"All lanes of the 101 Freeway were reopened late Sunday between Valley Circle and Reyes Adobe Road, officials said. However, offramps from Valley Circle to Liberty Canyon Road will remain closed until further notice.  Tweet Tweet","dateModified":"2018-11-12T06:50:48.322Z","datePublished":"2018-11-12T06:49:00.000Z","headline":"101 Freeway reopened between Valley Circle and Reyes Adobe Road in Woolsey fire","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#101-freeway-reopened-between-valley-circle-and-reyes-adobe-road-in-woolsey-fire"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageAt 29 dead and counting, the Camp fire in Butte County matched the deadliest fire on state record — a 47-acre scorcher that killed 29 people in Griffith Park in Los Angeles in 1933, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.Officials expect the death toll to rise in Butte, noting that 200 people are still reported missing.Here’s some background on the earlier fire from the pages of The Times:The 1933 Griffith Park blaze broke out Oct. 3, while thousands of civilians were clearing trails and maintaining roads in Griffith Park as part of a Depression-era jobs program.The first smoke was reported around 2 p.m., as temperatures soared toward 100 degrees with little wind. The workers turned their attention to fight the blaze.Around 3 p.m., the wind shifted, trapping the doomed laborers on a hillside of Mineral Wells Canyon, with the fire raging toward them from below, according to an account on the Conference of California Historical Societies website.“You could tell the progress of the fire by the screams,” one man said. “The flames would catch a man and his screams would reach an awful pitch. Then there would be an awful silence — then you would hear another scream. It was all over inside of seven minutes.”A month after the disaster, a plaque honoring the victims was placed by the Los Feliz Women’s Club near the park’s Vermont Avenue entrance. It eventually disappeared.A bronze sculpture commissioned by the Works Progress Administration to honor Conservation Corps workers was dedicated in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It was destroyed in a flood three years later.Finally, in 2007, the city honored the victims again with a tree planting that included a survivor from that day.","dateModified":"2018-11-12T04:15:02.816Z","datePublished":"2018-11-12T03:53:00.000Z","headline":"The 1933 Griffith Park fire was California’s deadliest.

Some survivors said they had only minutes to escape.Five of the bodies found Sunday were in homes. One was in a vehicle. Much of the area has still not been searched, and scores of people remain missing.“What I will say is we are very early in our efforts,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said. “There is still a great deal of work to do.”With the additional casualties, the Camp fire matched the deadliest fire on state record — a 47-acre scorcher that killed 29 people in Griffith Park in Los Angeles in 1933, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. It had already eclipsed last year’s Tubbs fire to become the most destructive.And yet the fire pushes on.As of Sunday night, the fire was 111,000 acres and 25% contained. Persistent winds have created spot fires that are sucking up resources that could be spent defending the larger blaze, including a 2,000-acre spot fire on the opposite side of the Feather River, said Joshua Bischof, a battalion chief with Cal Fire.Red flag conditions will last through Monday morning, creating a recipe of gusty winds and tinder-dry fuel that could spark another out-of-control fire or challenge defensive positions that crews have already set up, officials said.There are currently more than 200 people unaccounted for, Butte County sheriff’s officials said. Authorities are looking for them. Some of those reported missing were located at shelters, officials said.Residents who were able to outrun the fire said they still cannot fathom how much of their town was lost or imagine how many of their neighbors might be gone.“We not only lost our home,” said resident Sue Brown, “we lost a whole community. It’s gone. Paradise is gone.”The wind-swept fire exploded out of the mountains northeast of Paradise around dawn Thursday and started pelting the town’s rooftops with embers just before the full-scale firestorm came raging through the streets.Residents who scrambled to escape down the main highway were terrified by towering flames licking at their vehicles from both sides.Traumatized Paradise survivors were among 52,000 people chased out of their homes by the Camp fire. Many spent Saturday at evacuation centers in nearby Chico and Oroville.","dateModified":"2018-11-12T04:10:46.942Z","datePublished":"2018-11-12T02:20:00.000Z","headline":"Death toll jumps to 29 in Camp fire","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Joseph Serna"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#death-toll-jumps-to-29-in-camp-fire"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Greg and Alma Cwik didn’t evacuate their Bell Canyon home on Dapplegray Road when the order came out this week.Instead, the couple used the tools they could find to fight the flames that threatened their home Friday and Saturday. With the power knocked out Thursday night, they managed with LED lights. They used hoses and sprinklers, and when the water was shut off they grabbed buckets filled with pool water to fight the flames.The couple, who have lived in their home for seven years, pulled the cushions off their outdoor furniture and brought them into the kitchen so they wouldn’t catch fire.“Firefighters were here, but they were very few,” Alma Cwik, 63, said. “They were here, but when the fire went to Malibu and Hidden Hills, they went there.”Around noon Friday, she said, the canyon beneath their deck caught fire.

It’s traumatic for them. The wife cried.”He said the hill behind his home hadn’t burned yet, but nearly everything else around it had in the Woolsey fire. Levy, who has lived in Bell Canyon for eight years, said the area had never lost a house to a brush fire until this week.Earlier this week, he and the president of the local homeowners association drove around the neighborhood and tried to put out fires on their own. Driving down the local streets, they would grab garden hoses and whatever else was available to douse the flames.At one point, Levy said, he put out a fire in someone’s backyard.They were unable to save another home, where two jet skis on the side had caught fire and eventually ignited the entire house.As he recounted his story, people clapped, cheering the helicopter that had dropped water on the ridge.Irene Shaffa, who lives across the street from Levy, said she checked on her five-bedroom home Saturday and it had been spared. After evacuating on Friday, she stayed at her warehouse in Chatsworth along with some neighbors.But with the current flare-up and the heavy winds, she said she’s worried her house may not make it. She had been standing with the crowd at the intersection since about 8 a.m.“We come back every day,” she said. “We have nowhere to go.”Everyone who had gathered, she said, was hoping to get down the road to check on their home.“But it doesn’t look like we’re going to get in at all,” she said.","dateModified":"2018-11-11T21:59:58.864Z","datePublished":"2018-11-11T21:37:00.000Z","headline":"Claps and cheers as helicopter drops water on fire threatening homes in Bell Canyon","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#claps-and-cheers-as-helicopter-drops-water-on-fire-threatening-homes-in-bell-canyon"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"The California Highway Patrol said it might soon reopen the 101 Freeway, which has been closed for days due to the Woolsey fire. “Currently working to re-open the 101 Fwy in both directions, however ramps will be closed in the section between Valley Circle/Mulholland and Reyes Adobe.

Jerry Brown has requested a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration, citing the devastating fires burning in Northern and Southern California.At least 24 people have died and more than 6,000 structures have been lost in the Camp and Woolsey fires.Brown’s requests come a day after President Trump criticized California’s handling of forest and fire issues and threatened to cut off funding to the state.“There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!” Trump wrote.Trump said poor forest management policies caused the fires plaguing the state, even though the massive Woolsey fire didn’t occur in a forest.The Woolsey fire started near Simi Valley in a hillside area next to the old Santa Susana Field Lab and quickly spread into nearby suburban communities. Experts also noted the Camp fire was not a forest fire.From Brown’s request:If granted, a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration would make individuals in the impacted counties eligible for a number of programs and support, including crisis counseling, housing and unemployment assistance and legal services. The declaration would also help state, tribal and local governments with ongoing emergency response and recovery, including the repair and replacement of disaster-damaged facilities and infrastructure, including roads, bridges and utilities.Major fires burning in Northern and Southern California have claimed lives and caused extensive damage to residences and infrastructure. The Camp Fire in Butte County, which has burned more than 100,000 acres and decimated the Town of Paradise, already appears to be the most destructive fire in modern California history. The Hill and Woolsey fires in Southern California have burned more than 85,000 acres. More than 5,000 firefighters are working the front lines of wildfires statewide.A state of emergency has been declared in Los Angeles, Ventura and Butte counties due to multiple fires and late last week, California secured direct federal assistance to further support the impacted communities – within 24 hours of making the request. The Governor’s Office of Emergency Services has activated the State Operations Center in Mather, Calif., to its highest level and is coordinating with other local, state and federal emergency response officials to address emergency management needs.Brown's request for a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration can be found here.

Across the reservoir, Malibu Lake, she said the home of Robert Hays, the actor who starred in “Airplane,” burned down.Along Malibu Rancho Drive, near Lake Vista Drive, at least five homes were destroyed. Stone walls were still standing along with chimneys. Appliances were left charred amid the mangled rubble that was once the home of a neighbor.Tysseling said the fire began to make its way into the area around 7:30 a.m., and by 8 a.m. fires began to break out in Malibou Lake.  A few neighbors who stayed behind began pouring water on their rooftops and  around their property and that of their neighbors.Others decided to listen to authorities and left. She said some neighbors drove to Malibu only to be told to evacuate again.Tysseling threw her journals and the prison wardrobe used in the movie “Shawshank Redemption” by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, of which she is the proud owner, in her car.She said she did her best to inform residents who had evacuated about their homes. She said some of the roads were blocked by trees and power lines.Her neighbors were relieved to see she was OK. But most didn't agree with her decision to stay.At the end of South Lake Shore Drive, she came across one such neighbor.\"Are you OK?\" he asked.\"Yeah, I stayed.\"He gasped.\"Why would you do that?\"\"My house. It's all I got.\"\"But that's kind of irresponsible. You could have died.\"\"But I saved my house,\" she said.They chuckled.When the fire had made its way into the community, Tysseling said helicopters made some water drops but had to abandon the area to save other homes. At times, she and other neighbors felt they were left abandoned. But as bad as things got, the destruction seemed to fall short of how awful it could have been.At the clubhouse, Tysseling spoke to a neighbor and psychologist, who declined to give her name because of her profession.\"The wind was fierce and raging,\" she said, recalling the fire siege. \"It was like Armageddon.\"The woman said she and her husband drove to Malibu after they evacuated but again were forced to evacuate their Tivoli Cove home.  She said they eventually drove to their daughter's home in Eagle Rock.She said she's happy her home was saved.Tysseling told her the fire was burning above her home at one point.\"It was an act of providence that our house was spared between two houses that totally burned to the ground,\" she said.","dateModified":"2018-11-11T01:20:47.022Z","datePublished":"2018-11-11T00:50:00.000Z","headline":"In Malibou Lake, one woman’s simple answer for why she didn’t evacuate: ‘My house.

But on Friday, things had looked bad. Korrodi helped put out a spreading blaze at his brother-in-law’s townhome complex in Malibu Gardens, just a quarter mile down the road.“Our backyard was on fire and we decided we might as well do something about it,” said Korrodi’s brother-in-law, Jason Biheller.They jumped into their neighbors’ backyards and hooked up as many hoses as possible, smashed glass and grabbed fire extinguishers. Then they sprayed like mad.Korrodi, a personal trainer, said he’d like to think the worst is behind him. He was grateful to have a pantry full of food and a tank full of gas. But just as he was showing a reporter his view of the fire’s path the night before, a propane tank exploded a few hundred feet across the ridgeway, setting the side of a house ablaze.“Crap, I thought that fire was out,” he said, wiping sweat from his forehead. “If the wind picks up, that could be bad for us.”Jillian and Jim Williams also opted to stay and defend their home in Malibu Park.On Saturday morning, Jillian and her 16-year-old daughter, Ashleigh, had been camping out in the silver Hummer in the Zuma Beach parking lot for nearly 24 hours.They played cards and walked their Great Pyrenees, Sophie, to pass the time as they waited for Jim to return. Helpless. The day before, the patriarch had saved their home by pumping water from their backyard pool and onto the burning structure. Meanwhile, Ashleigh and Jillian worried about Jim, watching massive black clouds roll over the ocean and fire overtake the hillsides.      Jim  returned to the Zuma lot around midnight after several hours of firefighting. Barely able to hold his body upright and struggling to breathe, he collapsed inside his Mercedes and tried to fall asleep.He drove back up the hill soon after to make sure their home didn’t ignite again. At 10 a.m. on Saturday, Jillian said they hoped to return to their neighborhood – where the majority of homes had burned – later that day.\"There’s no word in the English dictionary to describe the fear we’ve felt. My life is up there,” Jillian Williams said, pointing across the desolate PCH. “At the same time, I feel selfish because I’m standing here and my neighbors don’t have houses anymore.” ","dateModified":"2018-11-11T00:51:41.179Z","datePublished":"2018-11-11T00:17:00.000Z","headline":"‘There’s no word in the English dictionary to describe the fear we’ve felt’","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4c4088e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+192/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F68%2F89%2F5d08e6c648dccf090536aa7fbed2%2Fla-lb-media-imagefromios7-20181110-160201","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Laura Newberry"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#theres-no-word-in-the-english-dictionary-to-describe-the-fear-weve-felt"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Tweet","dateModified":"2018-11-11T00:25:05.612Z","datePublished":"2018-11-11T00:11:00.000Z","headline":"Lost in Paradise, dog survived devastating fire.

Post-it notes and torn notebook paper were thumb-tacked to a message board with names and contact information of people searching for loved ones.“People have been subdued,” said Steve Walsh, a regional spokesman for the American Red Cross, which was operating the shelter. “They seem numb to what’s happening.”Standing next to his white truck in the church parking lot, Markham Odell recalled escaping from his property along the Feather River Canyon in Paradise Thursday morning.The sky, Odell said, became as black as midnight at 9:30 a.m. and as he was preparing to leave, a dead bird fell out of the sky and hit him in the shoulder . He felt overwhelming heat from the fire.“I’m 61,” Odell said. “I’ve never panicked at any time in my life. But I felt it start to come.”Odell, a prospector who works in Nevada, has lived on his property since 1987. A friend of the family sent him a photo after the fire came through. His home, greenhouse, barn and shed where he kept his tools were gone.“We’re homeless,” he said. “Most of our friends are homeless. Our family also.”One of the last things he grabbed before he left was a copy of his home insurance policy, which he said he recently updated.“This is a long haul,” Odell said. “This isn’t just one year.

He’s healthy.”On Friday, Malibu Wines, which has safari animals, had been evacuated and the animals were not in danger.But people on social media didn’t buy that after seeing a photograph of the giraffe with flames in the distance.  On Twitter, some people insisted Stanley and other animals, including llamas and a zebra, had been left behind with only sprinklers to protect them.Donation offers and pleas for help poured in, including from celebrities like “Modern Family” actress Ariel Winter and former ‘Nsync member Lance Bass. Khloe Kardashian also posted a series of tweets about Stanley and the devastation the Woolsey fire caused.Rehana Lodge, who lives in the Beverly Hills area, said some had been in touch with the San Diego Zoo and other animal rescue organizations to possibly remove the animals. The San Diego Zoo could not confirm the reports.A spokeswoman for PETA said the organization received calls about Stanley. “Although the fire approached extremely rapidly, it is unacceptable and unconscionable for a facility that keeps animals under lock and key not to have an emergency plan that allows for their immediate evacuation when one is called for—or to give those animals who don't pose a risk to anyone a fighting chance to escape,” Brittany Peet, PETA’s foundation director of captive animal law enforcement, said in a statement.The owners of Malibu Wines said repeatedly on Friday that the animals were OK and pleaded for people to stop interfering. “While we have lost a considerable portion of our barns and facilities, our primary concern is the lives our animal and human families,” the owners said in a post to Malibu Wine Safaris Instagram account. “We have a small number of number of animals unaccounted for but the search is continuing through the night.”The unaccounted for animals were a couple of horses that ran off the neighbors property, Dunn said. No animals were in the barn that burned down, he said.   The fire burned not far from the two dozen animals in the Malibu Wines safari, Dunn said. But they were protected, he said, because they were in a dirt field with a body of water and plenty of food nearby.

Karpus’ logic for staying was simple: “Obviously all big fires start with a small [one],” he said. The team focused on stamping out hot spots and creating barriers around their homes. With the Woolsey fire exploding to 70,000 acres over Friday night, firefighters are spread thin. “There definitely wasn’t enough manpower,” Karpus said. “They cannot be everywhere.”Bill and D’Marcel Napier took a proactive approach in their attempt to protect their home from the flames. Residents are required to have 100 feet of defensible space around their home. They decided on 200 feet instead.On Friday, they were grateful for that decision, as the Woolsey fire bore down on their neighborhood.Though the wind blew directly toward the Napiers’ home, when the fire reached their neighborhood late Thursday night, the flames spared it. The area around their home burned with less intensity because it had less fuel, they said. They were grateful to the firefighters for their swift efforts. At least four helicopters were in the area when the fire reached their home, they said.“[Because of] the fact this is where it started, we had great support,” D’Marcel Napier said.This is the third time their home has been threatened by fire.

Some were still waiting to find out whether they lost their homes. Others already knew they had.Around noon at the Zuma Beach parking lot, John Ridgway poured water into a collapsible bowl for his Australian shepherd, Rosalynn.The 66-year-old leaned against his Chevy Tahoe as ash fell onto the navy blue blazer he wore over his soiled white shirt and jeans. His friend had just told him the bad news: Ridgway’s home of 25 years in Malibu Park had burned, along with scores of other houses west of Busch Street.Ridgway, the chief executive of Novocom, a video design and music branding firm, had been at the parking lot since 8 a.m. Friday. He spent the day anxiously watching the fire grow across the highway.When the winds changed direction midday, a thick, purplish-black smoke illuminated by an orange glow swept over the parking lot, bearing down on everyone there.“It was like the gates of hell,” Ridgway said.It was at that point he first became concerned for his life. He worried that all those cars crowded in the lot might catch fire. He had hardly thought about his house, until he learned that it was gone.Ridgway, still numb and running out of food, was considering his options Saturday morning. He would probably stay with friends in Los Angeles or Santa Monica tonight, he said.But now that his home was gone, the future stretched before him like the sand and the ocean — hazy by the smoke, but full of possibilities. He always wanted to teach journalism, a field he worked in for many years, at Arizona State University. Or he might move to Washington State, which his ancestors helped settle in the 1800s, he said.Ridgway has lived alone for many years and had a hard time finding a partner, he said, because he was always traveling for work.“I had just started to think, now would be the time to settle down,” said Ridgway, who is semi-retired. “I thought, wouldn’t it be nice to stay home with the dog and get to know someone?”","dateModified":"2018-11-10T22:42:57.647Z","datePublished":"2018-11-10T22:28:00.000Z","headline":"Malibu resident contemplates a new future after losing his home","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ed75833/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+192/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbc%2F8b%2F5eac215560aae68312150d8d1501%2Fla-lb-media-imagefromios5-20181110-140718","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Laura Newberry"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#malibu-resident-contemplates-a-new-future-after-losing-his-home"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"California firefighters are slamming President Trump for a tweet Saturday in which he incorrectly asserted that this week’s devastating fires were the result of poor forest management.“There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,” Trump wrote. “Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!” California Professional Firefighters President Brian Rice said Trump was out of line.\"The president’s message attacking California and threatening to withhold aid to the victims of the cataclysmic fires is ill-informed, ill-timed and demeaning to those who are suffering as well as the men and women on the front lines,” Rice said in a statement.\"At this moment, thousands of our brother and sister firefighters are putting their lives on the line to protect the lives and property of thousands.

The fires in So. Cal are urban interface fires and have NOTHING to do with forest management. Come to SoCal and learn the facts & help the victims,” the Pasadena Firefighters Assn. said on Twitter.Experts have also said forest management was not a factor in California’s two most destructive fires: the Camp fire, which has burned more than 6,000 structures this week in Paradise, and the Tubbs fire last year in wine country.Forest thinning would not have stopped the Camp fire or Tubbs fire. Fueled by dry grass growing amid scattered pine and oak trees, the Camp fire tore across land thinned by flames just 10 years ago. The Tubbs fire burned grassy oak woodlands, not timberland.","dateModified":"2018-11-10T22:23:48.528Z","datePublished":"2018-11-10T21:58:00.000Z","headline":"Firefighters slam Trump for ‘shameful attack’ about California fires","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Shelby Grad"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#firefighters-slam-trump-for-shameful-attack-about-california-fires"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Tweet","dateModified":"2018-11-10T22:04:02.881Z","datePublished":"2018-11-10T21:53:00.000Z","headline":"Malibu homes are charred near a desolate Pacific Coast Highway","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Laura Newberry"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#malibu-homes-are-charred-near-a-desolate-pacific-coast-highway"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageAfter high winds caused the Woolsey fire to leap over the Pacific Coast Highway and barrel toward a seaside condominium complex Friday afternoon, firefighters knew they had to act fast to save the Malibu Bay Club community.Palm trees were catching fire in the complex’s northeast corner and one of the units quickly became engulfed in flames.“The wind was pushing through here, just making it damn near impossible to put this fire out,” said Santa Barbara County Fire Capt. Bryan Fernandez. Firefighters dumped about 5,000 gallons of water on the flames to no avail.So one of the firefighters climbed on the roof and used a chainsaw to cut a 4-foot-wide trench through the ceiling. Fernandez said the move helped direct the flames upward and prevent them from spreading to the rest of the building.“That is probably what saved this whole place from burning,” said Fernandez.  TweetIn the end, at least a half dozen condo units were affected. Fernandez expressed regret that they were unable to save all the homes. But residents were grateful. “I thought half this place was going to burn down.

Soon after, Gallagher was screaming as she and her family rushed into action.Tall, deep orange flames chewed timber near their home. Before they could scramble into their cars and leave, the fire had already crept to their driveway.Gallagher’s niece was last in the caravan, and as she left, burning branches landed on her car hood, Gallagher said.“It happened so quickly,” Gallagher said. “There were embers flying everywhere — our eyes were burning, and we couldn’t keep them open. We tried to put our shirts up against our faces, mostly fearing some embers were going to fall on us.”The wind was strong and the heat felt like it was blistering their skin as they ran to their cars, Gallagher said.Before making their escape, the family had sprayed down their house and yard with water, but they wanted to do more,. Since moving to Bell Canyon two years ago, they’ve fallen in love with the serenity of living in the lush wilderness.Bell Canyon is a safe community with low crime rates, Gallagher said. The fire is the first danger they’ve encountered since moving there.Their home is already full of memories, she said. Gallagher has an “open house” policy to their friends and family. She’s a caterer, and they know when they visit her, she’ll always have great food for them to try.Her home is where their family gathers during the holidays. During Christmas, there are at least 60 people in their home. That’s why she and so many other residents felt they had to try to make a stand, she said.“We all just have to stick together as a community and try to rebuild it and support each other,” Gallagher said.Gallagher has survived floods and earthquakes, but the Woolsey fire shook her in a way she had never experienced.“You can’t even explain how you feel and how your nerves get shot, and [in the moment] you really can’t think of anything other than just to save your life,” she said.","dateModified":"2018-11-10T21:34:49.740Z","datePublished":"2018-11-10T20:56:00.000Z","headline":"Family wakes to terror as flames approach their Bell Canyon home","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Jaclyn Cosgrove"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#family-wakes-to-terror-as-flames-approach-their-bell-canyon-home"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Tweet","dateModified":"2018-11-10T21:10:00.797Z","datePublished":"2018-11-10T20:43:00.000Z","headline":"Cable, internet and phone equipment damaged by fires","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Alejandra Reyes-Velarde"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#cable-internet-and-phone-equipment-damaged-by-fires"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageA vigil Thursday night for the victims of the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks was so packed that ushers barred people from entering the auditorium.Those left outside pressed their faces against the glass doors, trying to watch the service on the TV in the overflow room.

It had been a long day of reporting after the local elections, and he told his staff he might take Thursday off.Jorrey is the editor of the Thousand Oaks Acorn, a weekly paper that comes out every Thursday. The paper is part of a family of publications that covers nearby communities, including Simi Valley, Camarillo and Agoura Hills.But after Jorrey got home, he heard about the Borderline shooting. He rushed to the scene and worked till 4 a.m. to get a story up on the paper’s website. He then texted his two reporters: “When you wake up tomorrow, you’re going to be facing the biggest story you’ve ever faced.”His reporters worked overtime to cover what was undoubtedly the worst news event in Thousand Oaks in decades. And then the next day, they stayed up late into the night while fires raged in the region and led to hundreds of evacuations. Some of his staff were evacuated. The collision of these news events is unbelievable, especially as evacuations create more problems for his staff to deal with, he said.“There’s just nothing to compare it to,” said Jorrey.Jorrey's home wasn't evacuated, but he only managed to get a few hours of sleep on Thursday night. He was glued to the TV, but not for work this time. He wanted to make sure the fire wasn't barreling toward his neighborhood.As the fires moved unpredictably on Thursday night, many locals tweeted Jorrey, asking him if their homes were currently burning. He and his reporters tend to provide more granular coverage of evacuation zones, street closures and damaged neighborhoods than other media outlets, something many have thanked him for on social media.Jorrey chuckled thinking about how he reacted when he first got the news of the fire. He didn't want to cover it. He only has two reporters and they were exhausted. But eventually he came around.“When a story like that happens, you just can’t turn away from it, “ he said. “You’ve got to do it.”","dateModified":"2018-11-10T18:20:06.351Z","datePublished":"2018-11-10T17:58:00.000Z","headline":"A day after the worst news event they’ve covered, these journalists faced a relentless inferno","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1a70824/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7c%2F5c%2F423ea635122c6caaebfdbe9ecf6c%2Fla-lb-media-3064800-me-1109-woolsey-fire8-wjs-20181110-095756","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#a-day-after-the-worst-news-event-theyve-covered-these-journalists-faced-a-relentless-inferno"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageFirefighters battled through the night into Saturday morning to save communities from the raging Woolsey fire, which has exploded to 70,000 acres, destroyed scores of homes and forced 250,000 people to evacuate across a wide swath of Los Angeles and Ventura counties.The fire spread in several directions, burning homes in Malibu, Westlake Village and Thousand Oaks while threatening parts of Simi Valley, West Hills and numerous Ventura County communities.

Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!” Trump wrote.The Woolsey fire started near Simi Valley in a hillside area next to the old Santa Susana Field Lab and quickly spread into nearby suburban communities. Some firefighters took to social media to point out the distinction.“Mr. President, with all due respect, you are wrong. The fires in So. Cal are urban interface fires and have NOTHING to do with forest management. Come to SoCal and learn the facts & help the victims,” the Pasadena Firefighters Assn. said on Twitter.Experts have also said forest management was not a factor in California’s two most destructive fires: the Camp, which burned more than 6,000 structures this week in Paradise, and the Tubbs fire last year in wine country.Forest thinning would not have stopped the Camp or the Tubbs. Fueled by dry grass growing amid scattered pine and oak trees, the Camp tore across land thinned by flames just 10 years ago. The Tubbs burned grassy oak woodlands, not timber land.Trump has threatened to cut off funding over fire policy before, but has never been specific. California officials have rejected his criticism and said he’s playing politics.Environmentalists believe Trump is trying to use fire prevention as an excuse to raid California’s forests.Some condemned Trump’s tweet.\"The president’s message attacking California and threatening to withhold aid to the victims of the cataclysmic fires is Ill-informed, ill-timed and demeaning to those who are suffering as well as the men and women on the front lines,” Caifornia Profressional Firefighter Assn. President Brian Rice said in a statement. \"At this moment, thousands of our brother and sister firefighters are putting their lives on the line to protect the lives and property of thousands. Some of them are doing so even as their own homes lay in ruins. In my view, this shameful attack on California is an attack on all our courageous men and women on the front lines,” he added.Several celebrities also spoke out.“This is an absolutely heartless response. There aren’t even politics involved.

Burning trees and brush crackled and popped throughout the hillside.“This is the definitely the worst fire I’ve been through, and I’ve lived here almost 40 years,” Talley Hutcherson said. “If the fire makes it to PCH, what happens? Where do we go from there? Closer to the ocean? Just set the horses free? I don’t know what’s going to happen tonight.”Kathleen and Eric Lee, who have lived in Bell Canyon for two years, stood on the corner in West Hills wondering whether their home would still be there when they were finally allowed to return.At 4:30 a.m. Friday, they saw flames running down the hillside toward their backyard, more than 100 feet from their home.Kathleen Lee rushed to her neighbors’ homes, knocking on their doors until they answered.Almost no one had electricity or cellphone reception, limiting their access to emergency information, she said. Many in the community depend on devices that boost cell coverage, but they don’t work without electricity.The Lees tried to hose down their house until a sheriff’s deputy told them to leave at 11 a.m.Their neighbors were busy trying to protect their livestock.“It was surreal — we saw people walking their horses, their donkeys, their goats” to a nearby stable, Kathleen Lee said.Like many Bell Canyon residents, the couple had remained at the intersection for hours, leaving only for dinner. Many residents have slept in their cars, unable to find a hotel, she said.“There’s always hope they let you back in, but now, I don’t think so,” she said.“Not with that scene,” Eric Lee added, pointing to the burning glow radiating from the community.

You better get out now,” he recalled the neighbor telling him.Startled, Menz wasn’t left with much time to gather things from their home. He grabbed food, water and his medication — things he would need if they ended up having to sleep in the car.When he and his wife stepped outside, they found their neighbors lined up on the street and trying to catch a glimpse of the fire.“Every neighbor on both sides was out there,” he said. “We’re all looking at each other like: ‘Now where do we go? What do we do?’”Menz, who has lived in Thousand Oaks for 35 years, said he could see the flames licking the ridge in front of his home.“That’s how close it was,” he said.He said the weather station at his home picked up 55 mph winds Friday morning.“I thought my back fence was going to blow over,” he said, clutching his backpack.By 2 a.m., they reached the Goebel Adult Community Center, next door to the Thousand Oaks Teen Center.Since then, he’s been on the phone with his children to let them know he’s OK. His son, he said, worked for the Ventura County Fire Department as a firefighter before moving away.“He said, I’m about to jump on a plane and start helping,” Menz said. “I told him that’s not necessary.”Arita Kronska slept through news that her Westlake Village neighborhood had been placed under mandatory evacuation.She found out only when her daughter called her Friday morning around 5 a.m., worried.“I’ve lived here since 1998,” she said, standing on the lawn in front of the teen center in Thousand Oaks with her dog, Yoda. “This is the first time I’ve seen a fire like this.”Kronska said her home was about 11 miles from the evacuation center. As she stood in her home before she left, she wondered what she should take. She decided on two things: her passport and her dog.In the predawn hours, she said, her street was eerily quiet.“Nobody was there anymore,” she said. “It was a very strange feeling...no people, no driving...like in those movies about the apocalypse.”","dateModified":"2018-11-10T03:45:25.171Z","datePublished":"2018-11-10T03:30:19.000Z","headline":"At 1 a.m., a frantic banging on their back patio door: ‘There’s a fire coming’","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f5a9634/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F5f%2F7933f381ee82f8b934a30fc2363d%2Fla-1541793596-oztrnjh7h5-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#at-1-a-m-a-frantic-banging-on-their-back-patio-door-theres-a-fire-coming"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageA diner, a bridge, a mansion, a mobile home and a ranch were among the many structures that were destroyed by the Woolsey fire that swept through the Santa Monica Mountains on Friday.More than two dozen structures were visible from Kanan Road, a long meandering roadway dotted with multimillion-dollar homes that connects Agoura Hills to the Pacific Ocean. The total number of structures destroyed in the mountain communities is not known. At Kanan and Sierra Creek roads, a mailbox, two pillars, clay roof tiles and mangled kitchen appliances were left as charred rubble. A business sign with the name Kristy’s stood alone at the corner of the street. Resident Steve Karlovich said he used to go to the diner to play dominoes. He said a 1993 wildfire nearly wiped out the restaurant, but it was spared.Karlovich said he decided not to leave so he could to try to protect his home. His house survived.He said the fire was intense. “You look to your right, you look to your left ...” he said, before ending the sentence with an expletive.Next door, metal beams stood next to a burned white Prius with no trunk, its rims and windows melted by the intense heat. Nearby, a gas meter hissed as it flared.Less than half a mile away, a small bridge was destroyed at Troutdale Drive and Mulholland Highway. It had broken apart from the road and appeared ready to fall at any moment.Just before the bridge was the Peter Strauss Ranch, a regional park. The stone walls and chimney of the house were few of the things left standing, everything else was destroyed. The ranch was named after the Emmy-award winning actor.  The ranch had an Italian terrazzo tile concert area where country music legends Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson performed in the 1950s.At least one truck was left in the middle of the road. Power lines had fallen around every bend, and boulders had come loose from the mountain. Some horses had been left at one ranch but were unharmed. The fire had warped guardrails and taken down light poles. Several homes along the meandering road were still in flames, others charred and stripped down to skeletons.","dateModified":"2018-11-10T03:16:51.173Z","datePublished":"2018-11-10T03:05:00.000Z","headline":"Santa Monica Mountains communities can’t escape the wrath of the Woolsey fire","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91a9e2c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+192/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff1%2Ffd%2Fe2d43ededcf0843f420a03845df0%2Fla-lb-media-woolseyfire-20181109-190157","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#santa-monica-mountains-communities-cant-escape-the-wrath-of-the-woolsey-fire"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageEric Samways was walking his dog along East Hillcrest Drive in Thousand Oaks Friday afternoon when he saw smoke rising from a small hill on a property nearby.The house next to the smoke had burned down, and he wanted to make sure the fire wouldn’t spread. The 40-year-old tied his dog to a pole on the street and walked over to where two small logs had caught fire.Samways knocked on someone’s door, borrowed buckets, filled them with water and got to work. After he put out the flames, he turned his attention to several larger logs that were smoldering, but not on fire.All around him were the remnants of the front of someone’s home — a large dumpster, the remains of a truck and the skeleton of a motorcycle.The house that sat on the property about 50 feet away had also burned down, though the home behind it was untouched. “All it takes is for something to fly up in the sky to spread,” he said as he finished tending the logs.  “The property next door had paper everywhere.”Other residents barely escaped total loss.At around 11 a.m. Friday, Craig Lester grabbed his daughter and wife and started running. The family, who live on Ridgeford Drive in Westlake Village,  were surrounded by flames, but miraculously, their home was fine.“We didn’t think we needed to evacuate. The flames just started to come,” he said.Lester said that he didn’t receive any evacuation orders. He stood on the edge of the hill near home Friday afternoon and pointed to the ground that was still smoldering.“I’m concerned the fire could start back up. If it doesn’t get better we will leave tonight,” he said.Mark Fasano left Westlake at around 5 a.m. Friday. He returned seven hours later to see his townhouse engulfed in flames. He placed his hands on his head. A firefighter walked next to him. “Thank you,” Fasano told the firefighter, who was covered in black ash.Despite the loss, Fasano is counting his blessings. “It could have been worse,” he said looking at the flames. Fasano is thankful his children are safe and said that he feels lucky he has another house that he can live in. “I’m more upset for the parents who lost their children at the Borderline Bar & Grill shooting,” he said. “Material things can be replaced.”Groups of people walked along the parking lot of the Goebel adult center Friday morning, some with masks over their noses and others still in their pajamas from their early morning escapes.Joe Zimmermann and his wife caravanned with their family and friends from their home in Newbury Park around 6:30 a.m. Around four hours later, they stood next to their Ford F-150 and listened to his ham radio.“We were all a little anxious and wondering where we were going to go,” said Zimmermann, 57.“And how we were going to get there,” Audrey, 56, added, a mask covering her mouth and nose to protect her from the smoke.Some friends came over last night, they said, because they live in a trailer park that was threatened by the fire. Another friend, who lives in a mandatory evacuation area, decided to stay in his home.As she recounted her morning, a stranger walked up and asked if the couple needed any food or water. She grabbed a few bottles, then continued.“We were asleep when the alert went off,” she said. “It was for another area, so we went back to bed for an hour. Then another alert came, and after the third, we decided there wasn’t any going back to sleep.”At the time, she said, they couldn’t see the smoke from their home. But they didn’t want to get stuck without a way out.Before leaving, she went through the house, picking the things she found important enough to save.“It was easier than I thought,” she said. “I took family heirlooms, photos, and medication. I resolved that this is what I have. And I’m good with that.”","dateModified":"2018-11-10T02:14:10.949Z","datePublished":"2018-11-10T01:25:00.000Z","headline":"Despite losses, some residents are grateful they survived the flames unscathed","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7b65217/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+192/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F05%2F83%2Fdcd2c4d39d2bbcf55b127ba7861e%2Fla-lb-media-imagefromios2-20181109-162240","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Melissa Etehad"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#despite-losses-some-residents-are-grateful-they-survived-the-flames-unscathed"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Image","dateModified":"2018-11-10T02:23:29.275Z","datePublished":"2018-11-10T00:48:00.000Z","headline":"Mapping the fires across California","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6530359/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1128x635+0+247/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe5%2Fbc%2F1d3d400133f681782c3420b83235%2Fla-lb-media-statewide-fires-nov91-20181109-173830","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#mapping-the-fires-across-california"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Tweet ImageAs the Woolsey fire marched closer and closer to Zuma Beach on Friday, evacuees gathered under a pall of smoke and ash. Their horses, dogs, ponies and other pets crowded the sand.When Talley Hutcherson was ordered to evacuate her Old Agoura home earlier that morning, she didn’t have enough time to properly transport her horses.“There was just no time to do anything,” said Hutcherson, 57,  the owner of Connemara Ranch in Malibu. “Within hours we had to make the decision to come to the beach because the PCH was shut down.\"Hutcherson brought four of her horses down to beach, then drove to a second location to gather another six.

In Northern California, the Camp fire’s smoke had covered Sacramento and the Bay Area.  Image","dateModified":"2018-11-09T23:52:44.376Z","datePublished":"2018-11-09T23:32:00.000Z","headline":"Here’s what California’s fires look like 440 miles above Earth’s surface","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aa4afb9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+147/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6d%2Fd9%2F5321e1536354c7abf3f6e8fa8fdb%2Fla-lb-media-afp-getty-rapidly-spreadingwildfireincalifornia-20181109-151133","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Alejandra Reyes-Velarde"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#heres-what-californias-fires-look-like-440-miles-above-earths-surface"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageInside Neighborhood Church, an evacuation center in Chico, blankets were bunched up on green cots. Residents, many from Paradise, sat next to the few things they were able to bring with them in the rush to flee their homes: prescriptions, purses, papers and pets.In the hallway, people registered with Red Cross workers to help reassure friends and family members they were safe.Outside, people wandered in the chilly air, masks covering their faces, as bits of ash fell like snowflakes from a red sky. Some watched news coverage of the Camp fire on a television near the entrance of the church, or walked their dogs around the parking lot. Others stood in lines for food or to speak with insurance companies, which had set up mobile booths.Billie and Scott Salsbury relived a horrifying morning while waiting in line to speak with a Farmers Insurance agent. Like most other Paradise residents, they awoke Thursday to flames threatening their home. A house on their street had begun to burn.“I called 911 and they said we have 400 calls before you,” said Billie Salsbury, 55.The Salsburys and their son gathered their things quickly and drove to the end of the road, where they met bumper-to-bumper traffic.Not long after, the slow-moving line of cars turned into a small valley with heavy brush along the side of the road. Traffic stopped. Officials closed the road ahead and behind them because of approaching flames.“All we could hear is explosions around us,” said Scott Salsbury, 56, describing the panic and anxiety as the couple sat in the car, unable to go anywhere.Police reopened the road ahead after 30 minutes, and the two drove to Chico to stay with their daughter.“Where are we going to live?” Billie asked, tears welling in her eyes. “That’s my thing.”In front of them in line, Marty Nelson, 60, stood with his son.A retired nursing supervisor for the state, Nelson said he moved to Paradise from Hidden Valley Lake, a fire-ravaged community in Lake County. The 2015 Valley fire scorched his property and burned six houses on his block, he said.“One of the reasons we wanted to move was to get away from the fires,” he said. “Now there’s a strong possibility that my house was lost. I don’t even have a suitcase.”","dateModified":"2018-11-09T22:50:55.046Z","datePublished":"2018-11-09T22:25:00.000Z","headline":"In Chico, people who fled the fire in Paradise gather at emergency shelter, wondering what’s next","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3e1fe1f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+192/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F41%2F7d%2F726ca261f33ab016eccde3dbe388%2Fla-lb-media-imagefromios2-20181109-142029","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#in-chico-people-who-fled-the-fire-in-paradise-gather-at-emergency-shelter-wondering-whats-next"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageComcast has opened 3,200 Xfinity Wi-Fi hot spots throughout Yuba and Butte counties in Northern California to help residents and emergency personnel stay connected during the Camp fire, the company announced Friday.The hot spots are free and are available to anyone, regardless of whether they are Xfinity customers.

Her daughter’s car, parked in the driveway, was reduced to its metal frame. The garage door and her daughter’s bedroom above it were burned too, the frame and windows now an ash black.Text alerts and a message from her cable provider left on her TV screen urged Hertel, 68, to leave her house in the wee hours of the morning. She left around 1 a.m.Before getting into the car, she stopped at the front door. She gave it a kiss and prayed to God that her house would still be there when she returned.“I left thinking everything would be OK,” she said through tears. “You don’t think your house will burn down.”Hertel recalled the feeling of the heat of the flames across the street when she left. The home directly across from hers was spared, but another across the street was reduced to a single brick chimney.She returned around 5 a.m., when police were still there. An officer let her inside for about five minutes — enough time to grab a few of the memories of her mother she had left behind, including an old painting of the Santa Monica pier. She initially took photos of her daughter’s, important documents and a large photo of her mother, who died two years ago.“It’s like that saying, you don’t think it would happen to you,” she said. “I’m just lost for words.”Hertel learned that her home had been burned after a friend told her she saw it on TV. She immediately went to her niece’s house, frantically knocking on the door. She needed to watch the news, Hertel told her.“It was so surreal.”Walking though the home late Friday morning, Hertel stopped at her daughter’s room at the top of the stairs. The window had blown out, and the bed and dressers were covered in ash. The ceiling fan and walls were left with scorch marks and peeling paint.“This is unbelievable,” she said of her daughter’s room. “This is her safe haven, her room. It’s no longer habitable.”She paused, tears streaming down her cheeks.“How a fire can change your life in a few days,” she sobbed.As she surveyed the home, her husband, her niece and some friends tended to the damage. They hoisted wooden boards and drilled them into where the windows once were.Hertel stepped into a room and came back out with a ceramic rabbit.“Look what made it,” she mused. “My good luck charm.”In the backyard, much of her furniture was strewn across the patio; burned magazines littered the floor. The fence separating her yard from her neighbor’s was wrecked.“I don’t even know that I even understand what happened here,” she said.She took the fire — and the water damage she had just fixed in her home last month — as a sign that she should leave the city she’s lived in her entire life, she said. Her other daughters and granddaughter live in Kentucky, she said, and she wants to watch the little girl grow up.“This will always be my home, but Kentucky is where I’ll live,” she said.

The fires and the mass shooting Wednesday night at Borderline Bar and Grill had led to some jangled nerves for both his family and his students.“We feel safe, but no community is safe from these type of events,” Steiner said.His family relocated to his mother’s home in Eagle Rock, but he’s still trying to keep in touch with the families of students who may have been evacuated.Staying busy is key. He already had logged 11,000 steps by 11 a.m.“Being calm at this time of stress and disaster is key,” he said. “I’m trying to keep it inside. Sometimes I need to close my door for a minute.”For the dozens of evacuees taking shelter in the high school, it has been a stressful couple of days. Chimo Casanova, 69, had been displaced twice. Thursday afternoon, as the Hill fire’s flames were nearing his home of 16 years, the Dos Vientos resident got word that he needed to get out. He and his wife decided to go to his daughter’s home in Oak Park, but the next morning, the flames from the Woolsey fire caught them. Casanova, his wife, son-in-law and two grandchildren headed to the Taft High School evacuation center. “The kids think this is the best thing ever,” Casanova said.His 7-year-old grandson jumped from bed to bed in the gymnasium.The Taft High center, which holds about 150 beds, has been at capacity all morning, and some were unable to enter. Tracey Moechel wasn’t allowed in because she brought her pug, Mugsy, who is 11 1/2 years old.  So she sat on a folding table in the gym’s atrium as Mugsy sat in his stroller.After sleeping for just an hour, Moechel woke about 3 a.m. to find a Los Angeles police officer knocking on the door of her Agoura Hills home. It was time to go, and she called an Uber, which took 17 minutes to arrive.“I got lucky someone came,” Moechel said.Both Moechel and Casanova wondered about the state of their homes. They still haven’t heard anything and aren’t sure where they’ll spend the night.","dateModified":"2018-11-09T22:37:20.936Z","datePublished":"2018-11-09T21:28:00.000Z","headline":"Evacuees displaced by both Hill and Woolsey fires","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a8860ea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+192/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F41%2F94%2Fff420d8547dccdc271334059c15a%2Fla-lb-media-img-0706-20181109-112747","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Benjamin Oreskes"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#evacuees-displaced-by-both-hill-and-woolsey-fires"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageArita Kronska slept through news that her Westlake Village neighborhood had been placed under mandatory evacuation as the Woolsey fire showed no signs of slowing.The 62-year-old only found out when her daughter called her Friday morning around 5 a.m., worried.“I’ve lived here since 1998,” she said, standing on the lawn in front of the Thousand Oaks Teen Center  with her dog, Yoda. “This is the first time I’ve seen a fire like this.”Kronska said her home was about 11 miles from the evacuation center. As she stood in her home before she left, she wondered what she should take. She decided on two things: her passport and her dog.In the predawn hours, she said, her street was eerily quiet.Joe Menz and his wife, Teresa, also had an early morning. They woke up around 1 a.m. to the sound of their neighbor pounding on their back patio door.“There’s a fire coming and it’s mandatory evacuation. You better get out now,” he recalled the neighbor telling him.Startled, Menz wasn’t left with much time to gather things from their home. He grabbed food, water and his medication — things he would need if they ended up having to sleep in the car.When he and his wife stepped outside, they found their neighbors lined up on the street and trying to catch a glimpse of the fire“Every neighbor on both sides was out there,” he said. “We’re all looking at each other like, ‘Now where do we go? What do we do?’”Menz, who has lived in Thousand Oaks for 35 years, said he could see the flames licking the ridge in front of his home.“That’s how close it was,” he said.He said the weather station at his home picked up 55 mph winds Friday morning.“I thought my back fence was going to blow over,” he said, clutching his backpack.By 2 a.m., they reached the Goebel Adult Community Center, next door to the Teen Center.Since then, he’s been on the phone with his children to let them know he’s OK. His son, he said, worked for the Ventura County Fire Department as a firefighter before moving away.“He said, I’m about to jump on a plane and start helping,” Menz said. “I told him that’s not necessary.”","dateModified":"2018-11-09T21:37:45.977Z","datePublished":"2018-11-09T21:20:00.000Z","headline":"Residents scramble to gather belongings and find shelter  in Thousand Oaks evacuation centers","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7fe2608/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+172/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6d%2Fc9%2F55bcb0c7ef2e3d1d7a50cecd90b3%2Fla-lb-media-imagefromios4-20181109-123717","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#residents-scramble-to-gather-belongings-and-find-shelter-in-thousand-oaks-evacuation-centers"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageDebbie Sneed-Barnett and her husband, Mike Barnett, slept in their minivan in the Pierce College evacuation center’s parking lot with their three boys — ages 4, 5 and 11 — two dogs and a cat.“It was chaos in there,” said Sneed-Barnett, 37.About 900 evacuees fleeing the Woolsey fire had checked into the evacuation center by 8:30 a.m. Friday, and a second gym would soon open to meet increasing demand, said Rolf Schleicher, vice president of administrative services at the college.All still wearing pajamas, the Barnett family had left their home in Thousand Oaks at 3:30 a.m. and grabbed breakfast at Denny’s. It was the family’s first evacuation, and everyone was fighting a cold.

The two Pepperdine students, who share a suite on campus, were awakened at 6 a.m. to news of canceled classes and evacuation orders.The women packed a bag and went to the cafeteria by 7:30 a.m. as instructed by school officials. But Tipton-Ortiz’s father told her to come home, and to bring De Clair too.“All the stuff that happened yesterday too, it’s just like everything happened all at once,” Tipton-Ortiz said. “It’s so strange. It’s sketching me out.”In another car was Quinn Kuriger, 22, of Calabasas, who found refuge Thursday night at a friend’s Malibu home. But as the fire moved further south, he was forced to move again. This time, Kuriger gathered his belongings and headed to Santa Monica.He’d been in the line of cars for at least two hours. The most he’s seen of the fire is the large cloud of smoke nearby.“It’s kind of intimidating,” he said.At the 76 gas station off PCH, power had been out since 9 a.m., leaving the station without functioning pumps. People paid cash for water and snacks inside the station.Residents in the area faced a tough decision: brave the congested highway with little to no gas or wait for the power to be restored.On the highway nearby, people began driving on the wrong lane and turning into a single-direction artery going south.John Rodrigue of Malibu waited for the power to be restored. Rodrigue’s El Nido neighborhood in Corral Canyon was under mandatory evacuation. When he looked at his gas gauge and the traffic backed up for miles on the PCH he feared he might get stranded.“We won’t want to run out of gas on the PCH,” he said as he walked his dog, Ellie. His fiancée sat inside their car parked near more than a dozen other vehicles waiting for gas.Maribel Palencia, 45, of South L.A., had commuted to her housekeeping job on Broad Beach early Friday morning. She evacuated around 9 am and it took her 3 hours to get to Corral Canyon, only about seven miles away. By then, she had almost run out of gas.“I feel very worried because I have no gas or phone reception and I know it is coming,” she said as she pointed to a smoke plume.-- Times staff writer Ben Poston contributed to this report.","dateModified":"2018-11-09T21:45:01.337Z","datePublished":"2018-11-09T21:16:00.000Z","headline":"Pepperdine University shelters in place as traffic inches along the Pacific Coast Highway","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#pepperdine-university-shelters-in-place-as-traffic-inches-along-the-pacific-coast-highway"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageRafael Garcia, 58, ran and grabbed a garden hose, tossed it through his home’s fence and hopped over.He quickly began spraying water as portions of the home’s porch fell apart.

had been a hellish 24 hours for Thousand Oaks resident Melissa Snyder. A close family friend, Noel Sparks, 21, was killed in the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill on Wednesday night.Snyder has known Sparks since she was a baby and could barely make sense of that tragedy, which unfolded minutes from her home in the Hillcrest neighborhood.On Friday morning, Snyder stood in her robe outside a Manhattan Bagel shop in a Woodland Hills parking lot, surrounded by her husband and five of her kids.They left their home overnight as the Woolsey fire crept closer and a mandatory evacuation order was issued.Snyder said her teenage daughter Kaylee got a frantic call from a friend that they needed to get moving. Kaylee described the drive south on the 101 Freeway as “like you were leaving hell.” Her dad, Steve Snyder, said the highway was “crowded for 3 a.m. but it still was moving.”Kaylee, 16, had attended a vigil at the Calvary Church on Thursday for victims of the Borderline shooting, and said “it started smelling like smoke during the service.”“I’m confused and overwhelmed,” she said.Son Austin, 8, ran around with a cinnamon bagel in his mouth and cream cheese smeared on his face while talking a mile a minute.Melissa forced a smile and a laugh as she watched her kids play and contemplated when they might make their way home. They think their house survived.“We didn’t get over the one tragedy until the next thing started,” Melissa said, a tired look on her face.Steve Snyder said their nerves were somewhat frayed from the lack of sleep. As news of the Borderline tragedy broke, they weren’t sure whether the shooter had been apprehended. They thought he might be in their neighborhood and stood by the door just in case.“It’s been two nights of no sleep,” he said standing next to his minivan.“That would be awesome if we could get home today.”","dateModified":"2018-11-09T19:18:23.833Z","datePublished":"2018-11-09T18:20:00.000Z","headline":"Family evacuated from Thousand Oaks home after 24 hours of tragedies","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/78ea3e7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+192/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc5%2F38%2Fe111a5704327322d04b9fdbffdfd%2Fla-lb-media-imageuploadedfromios-20181109-090015","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"ben oreskes"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-griffith-park-live-updates-htmlstory.html#family-evacuated-from-thousand-oaks-home-after-24-hours-of-tragedies"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageA small fire broke out behind the Los Angeles Zoo on Friday morning, drawing away more than 100 firefighters and water-carrying aircraft desperately needed to battle a more dangerous blaze to the west.The fire was spotted just before 8 a.m. near fire roads, hiking trails and a landfill in a remote section of Griffith Park, presenting a challenge for crews trying to access the area, said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Peter Sanders. Officials began evacuating some of the zoo’s animals about an hour later, starting with the lemurs. Outside the zoo, workers frantically carried out a dozen cages carrying parrots, condors and other exotic birds that were nearest the smoke and flames. The fire had broken out near the condor exhibit.They were being set outside the zoo until a safe location in the park could be found, officials said.Later, officials said the zoo would be closed for the day.Within an hour of the fire first being spotted, several city, county and privately contracted water-dropping helicopters were orbiting the park trying to knock down the flames. The blaze had burned approximately three acres about an hour after it began, but that quickly jumped to 30 acres, Sanders said. “There’s no wind here right now unlike in Ventura [County,]” Sanders said, referring to the conditions crews are facing with a fast-moving blaze threatening thousands of homes to the west. “Our priority right now is to protect the zoo property.”While some crews were busy hiking through rugged terrain to reach remote areas to set up defensive lines, others were stationed in the zoo parking lot, waiting to be deployed. Sanders said firefighters were planning on setting up a defensive perimeter around the blaze to stop its forward progress and then would attack the fire directly.The fire was producing a thick smoke plume visible across much of greater L.A., but it was not threatening any structures, Sanders said.","dateModified":"2018-11-09T19:24:25.003Z","datePublished":"2018-11-09T18:20:00.000Z","headline":"L.A.

More than 88,000 homes have been evacuated across Los Angeles and Ventura counties.“It’s been a long night,” said Corey Rose, assistant chief with L.A. City Fire Department. “But what makes this good is that we’ve done it together.”Overnight, the blaze jumped the 101 Freeway and was marching toward the Pacific Ocean, prompting portions of cities from Calabasas to Thousand Oaks to Malibu to be evacuated.Officials are focusing on preventing any fatalities, but for the 2,000 firefighters, the dangerous terrain and winds are putting them at risk.“It’s tough, we don’t want anyone to get hurt. There’s so many pockets of roads in these communities,” Rose said.David Richardson, chief deputy of the L.A.
