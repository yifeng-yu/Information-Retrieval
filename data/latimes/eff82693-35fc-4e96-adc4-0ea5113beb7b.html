TweetImplications of violence are generally considered a step beyond in modern political discourse; outrage was the response Ted Nugent when he called for then-President Obama and Hillary Clinton to be tried and hanged, and when then-candidate Trump made reference on the campaign trail to \"2nd Amendment people\" stopping Clinton.Though Nugent and Trump have both ended up in the White House at one point or another, it's unclear if Griffin will escape this furor unscathed. Griffin serves as co-host for CNN's New Year's Eve special alongside Anderson Cooper and pressure is rising for the cable news provider to drop Griffin from the festivities.Representatives for Griffin and CNN did not immediately respond to a request to comment. ","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:55:51.051Z","datePublished":"2017-05-30T23:13:00.000Z","headline":"Kathy Griffin shocks in gory photo shoot with Donald Trump’s (fake) head","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bd02b6e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F91%2F9a%2F234cf32668d3d3b567322d1a0918%2Fimg-54b6fd32-turbine-la-ca-2015-celebrity-pictures-004","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Libby Hill"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#kathy-griffin-shocks-in-gory-photo-shoot-with-donald-trumps-fake-head"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe coroner reportedly says \"Happy Days\" actress Erin Moran died of complications from cancer and cancer alone.

It had spread to her spleen, she had alot of fluid in her lungs and part of her brain was infected,\" Fleischmann wrote. \"The coroner said even if she was in the hospital being pumped full of antibiotics she still would not of made it.

It makes me sad that she won’t, that they will never know her.\"The prince was just 15 when his mother was killed in a high-speed car crash on Aug. 31, 1997, and he and younger brother Harry were left to deal with their grief under great public scrutiny.While Prince William has of late found the words to speak publicly about his mother, the journey to that place has not always been easy.\"It has taken me almost 20 years to get to that stage,\" William said. \"I still find it difficult now because at the time it was so raw. And also it is not like most people’s grief, because everyone else knows about it, everyone knows the story, everyone knows her.\" InstagramIt may have taken years, but William and Harry have found a way to honor their mother in a fashion that she would likely greatly appreciate: charitable work.Known as the \"People's Princess,\" Diana was a tireless advocate for those in need and worked to destigmatize AIDS in the 1980s, to fight the use of landmines and to better the lives of the underprivileged. In the last year, William and his brother, alongside William's wife, Kate, have expanded their involvement in Heads Together, a mental health campaign led by the Royal Foundation, which aims to start a productive conversation about the reality of mental illness.\"Smashing the taboo is our biggest aim. We cannot go anywhere much until that is done. People can’t access services till they feel less ashamed, so we must tackle the taboo, the stigma,\" William said.The Heads Together campaign has sparked several headlines for the royal family in recent months. In April, Prince Harry admitted that the death of his mother left him \"very close to a complete breakdown\" for which he finally sought professional help three years ago.  \"The experience that I've had is once you start talking about [mental health], you suddenly realized, actually, you're part of a big club ... and everybody's gagging to talk about it,” Harry said during the \"Mad World\" podcast with Bryony Gordon.The GQ interview is not the only conversation that Prince William has had recently about mental health, either. He participated in a highly publicized FaceTime chat with Lady Gaga on the matter.In the interview, Prince William acknowledged that his public persona might suggest otherwise, but privately, he is impassioned about the issue.\"I cannot understand how families, even behind closed doors, still find it so hard to talk about it. I am shocked we are so worried about saying anything about the true feelings we have,\" the prince said.Prince William's full interview with British GQ is available in its July issue, on newsstands June 1.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:59:56.927Z","datePublished":"2017-05-30T16:14:00.000Z","headline":"Prince William talks about ‘taboo’ of mental illness and death of Diana in new interview","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ea9dfec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+208/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fa9%2F9fadb45bd0995ae0526835b30a63%2Fimg-592d891e-turbine-la-1496156442-k4kkgelbjs-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Libby Hill"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#prince-william-talks-about-taboo-of-mental-illness-and-death-of-diana-in-new-interview"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageDays after daughter Ariana Grande issued a statement about last week's post-concert bombing in Manchester, England, mom Joan Grande posted her own thoughts about the incident that left 22 dead and scores more injured. \"I join my daughter in extending my help & services to all those affected by the diabolical act of terror which occurred in Manchester!\" she wrote on Twitter as a Memorial Day message that also thanked U.S. servicemen and women. \"My heart goes out to all the victims: those who lost their lives, those injured, those recovering & all survivors of that night, along with the families and friends whose grief knows no bounds.\"The elder Grande was still in her front-row seat at the show, about to go see her daughter backstage, when the suicide bomb went off, TMZ reported.

And I want young girls to know that's NOT my intention,\" she wrote in a message that was split into Part 1 , Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, Part 5 , Part 6, Part 7 and Part 8.Hyland, 26, was referring to a host of comments made on an Instagram post Tuesday where she promoted a T-shirt, from her boyfriend Dominic Sherwood's apparel line, that gives part of the proceeds to an anti-bullying campaign. (Yes, she noted the irony.) Instagram\"My circumstances have put me in a place where I'm not in control of what my body looks like,\" she wrote Wednesday. \"Oh and no that's not photoshop. Those are my legs. Those are my arms.\" Here's the thing: Hyland was born with a host of health issues, including kidney dysplasia, as she previously described to Seventeen; her dad donated one of his kidneys to her for a transplant in 2012.She's \"basically been on bed rest for the past few months\" and is trying to keep her weight up despite the fact that the medications she is taking have, in part, played havoc with her tastebuds (prednisone has a way of doing that). She's been told she can't work out, and she's lost a lot of muscle mass.\"I don't mind when you say that I look pregnant. Or fat. Because I know that my face is swollen from medication that is saving my life. For those on prednisone I know what you're going through and I commend you sticking it out as I have,\" Hyland said.  Tweet\"My self confidence is not rendered from your comments. Because I will always be too fat. I will always be too skinny. I will never have enough curves to be called a woman. And I will always be a slut for wearing a push up bra,\" Hyland said. \"Love the you you set out to be. Be the best version of yourself. Be healthy. I'm a 26 year old woman who goes through more than you could even imagine on a daily basis. But I work hard. I love hard.

Having movie reviewers see it for you!Los Angeles Times critic Jen Yamato was in the Enjoy It for What It Is camp, describing the film thusly: \"[I]t not only owns its dumbness but hurtles itself all the way back around through a flurry of genitalia jokes and F-bombs to splash unapologetically in an R-rated surf of winking postmodernism, led by the charismatic Dwayne Johnson, Hollywood’s most unsinkable movie star.\"But although not everyone hates it — 64% of audiences dug it, according to Rotten Tomatoes — a lot of reviewers put the bouncing-beach-bodies flick firmly in its place, damning it, and then damning it with faint praise. That said, here are a few snacks, both bad and (relatively) good, from the \"Baywatch\" snark buffet. Over at the Chicago Tribune, they took the \"Yeah, and ...?\" approach to the review. The Bad: \"The movie's comic instincts... are consistently coarse and frequently scrotal.\" The Good: \"The bodies on screen are pretty, which I seem to remember was a selling point of the 1989-2001 TV series.\" As we said, yeah, and ...? The Roger Ebert website perhaps cut closest to the bone, pulling few punches. The Bad: \"[T]his is another one of those raunchy comedies that’s barely a movie, that looks like it was edited by dumping a bunch of footage into whatever movie-cutting software they’re using and hitting 'randomize.'\"The Good: \"[T]he movie has a pervading air of crass amiability about it — it’s almost like a two-hour end-credits gag reel. (Nevertheless, it contains an end credits gag reel.) Now could you tell us what you really think?:Rolling Stone painted a vivid picture of the \"Baywatch\" experience.The Bad: \"Think of yourself sitting down for a big two-hour wallow in instant stupid with a vat of popcorn, slathered in fake butter and possibly a mound of melted M&Ms on top. It feels great chugging it down, then your stomach hurts, your head aches and you puke the whole thing up so you can forget about it in the morning. That's 'Baywatch' in a nutshell. Happy puking.\"The Good: \"Of the recent spate of moldy TV material morphing into movies, with '21 Jump Street' on top and 'CHIPs' bringing up the rear, 'Baywatch' barely escapes the basement. One reason it does: The Rock.\"Helpful! Turns out if you liked \"21 Jump Street\" and \"CHiPs,\" this flick is for you! The New York Times loosened up its necktie for this one.The Bad: \"The digital effects — fire and water, mostly — are lackluster, and the whole thing has a crummy, overcast, second-rate-theme-park look to it.\"The Good: \"Like its source material, “Baywatch” is sleazy and wholesome, silly and earnest, dumb as a box of sand and slyly self-aware. It’s soft-serve ice cream. Crinkle-cut fries. A hot car and a skin rash. Tacky and phony and nasty and also kind of fun.\"Tacky? Phony? Nasty? We didn't know it was a date movie.The Washington Post, of course, just couldn't leave politics out of it. The Bad: \"It’s no shock that the women in 'Baywatch' don’t have much to do beyond look good. ... Maybe dodging bad lines was a relief for the actresses. It’s not like the screenplay, by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, gives performers a lot to work with.\"The Good: \"If, indeed, Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson ditches Hollywood to become our next commander in chief, 'Baywatch' may be singled out as the low point of his pre-political career.\"Well, at least Johnson has that out of the way. The Tampa Bay Times went deadpan.The Bad: \"Imagining Johnson and genetically gifted co-stars in swimsuits is all it took to pitch Baywatch. Director Seth Gordon and six writers didn't come up with much beyond that.\"The Good: \"What Baywatch has in its favor is Dwayne Johnson fireman-carrying a dead weight comedy to safety.\"We think that's a compliment. Maybe. Variety noted the film's nods to current market and societal trends.The Bad: \"'Baywatch' ... is a stupidly entertaining trash folly, the kind that could only be made today: an obscenity-and-insult-laced, aggressively 'competent' adaptation of a 25-year-old TV show that manages to repackage every aspect of the series except, perhaps, the reason it was popular in the first place. The Good: \"They wear their butt-hugging red bathing suits with dignity and pride, which makes this a highly sexually responsible 'Baywatch.'\"The reviewer at the New York Post appeared to be familiar with the TV series' global success. The Bad: \"Even the action scenes need CPR, often undermined by effects so chintzy, you wonder if the money intended for them was instead eaten up by the production’s seven-figure waxing budget.\"The Good: \"On the bright side, it’ll probably do killer business in Germany.\"Wait, were they just dissing the Hoff? Finally, one need go no further than the AV Club to understand Rotten Tomatoes' 19% positive critics' rating. The Bad: \"[N]obody  —not even the filmmakers  —cares about 'Baywatch' all that much. Yet the joke’s on them: In spoofing something so forgettable, they’ve made something even less memorable.\"The Good: \"Nobody cares about 'Baywatch.'\"'Nuff said.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:54:13.428Z","datePublished":"2017-05-25T17:12:00.000Z","headline":"‘Happy puking’: ‘Baywatch’ is the summer blockbuster critics love to hate","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Christie D’Zurilla"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#happy-puking-baywatch-is-the-summer-blockbuster-critics-love-to-hate"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"After a number of weeks filled with late-breaking developments on the Trump administration's apparent ties to Russia, Wednesday night was a chance for late-night hosts to sort of catch their breath and essentially choose their own adventure.Jimmy Kimmel focused on the seemingly less-than-happy photos of the pope with President Trump that circulated on Wednesday, while Stephen Colbert took a brief swipe at the $2-trillion double-counting error in Trump's budget.Seth Meyers, however, took advantage of his show's \"A Closer Look\" segment to make time for all of the above.After addressing the photo of the stone-faced pope with Trump, Meyers recapped the latest developments in the investigations into whether, among other things, the president engaged in obstruction of justice by firing FBI Director James Comey.

The U.S. is considering leaving the landmark Paris climate pact, a hostile appointee leads the Environmental Protection Agency, and right-wing websites chortle, “Trump’s Latest Move Will Make Al Gore Fry.”But is Al Gore himself despondent or depressed about it all? Not in the slightest.“I’ve been inoculated in the year 2000,” he says, combining a burst of genial good humor with a reference to his presidential election loss to George W. Bush. “I now have a resistance to being disheartened, the antibodies are still thriving in my bloodstream.“As we all learn, one of the hidden secrets of the human condition is we learn the most from our most painful experiences.” ImageTo spend time with Al Gore is to meet a man enough at ease with himself to dress as if for a Senate hearing in white shirt, suit and tie even though he’s in the south of France; a warm, engaged, surprisingly funny individual whose innate courtesy has him personally hang a reporter’s sports coat on a nearby hotel room hanger.Yes, he does tend to stay on message when he talks (how could he not) and he likes to draw graphs in the air with his hands (“I’m going to get a little geeky for a moment,” he apologizes with a smile, “I’m sorry, it’s a failing”).But he combines this with good-humored self-awareness and a fiercely committed intelligence.“If you think I’m earnest now, you should have seen me earlier,” he says. “You can’t change who you are. At times I’ve tried, but I’m old enough to stop worrying.”Gore is in Cannes to promote the worldwide release of an impassioned and involving new documentary, “An Inconvenient Sequel.” Due in U.S. theaters on July 28, it brings us up to speed on where the battle against climate change stands more than a decade after the Oscar-winning documentary “An Inconvenient Truth.”“I’m here for a lot of to-ing and fro-ing” is how Gore puts it. “I think I’ve done 75 seven-minute interviews — Japan, Russia, Brazil, everywhere.“The day before yesterday I was live on [the French cable channel] Canal Plus when the interpreter talking in my earpiece was evacuated from his building because of a bomb scare. The questioner was going a mile a minute in French, but because of those 75 seven-minute interviews, I picked up enough key words to fight my way through it.”Gore has been concerned with climate change since he took a class with pioneering global warming theorist Roger Revelle as a college student in the 1960s. Not only did Gore “never imagine when I was a young man that this would become an all-consuming body of work for me,” he also never anticipated that the work would involve the movies.More than that, he was frankly dubious about both of his films.Read More","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:00:15.771Z","datePublished":"2017-05-24T23:25:00.000Z","headline":"Al Gore on the French Riviera: Why he was reluctant to make ‘An Inconvenient Sequel’","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e102e81/2147483647/strip/true/crop/750x422+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F52%2F2e%2Ffab83f44de578b4a30240ff2c386%2F750x422","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Kenneth Turan"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#al-gore-on-the-french-riviera-why-he-was-reluctant-to-make-an-inconvenient-sequel"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageEllen DeGeneres is working on a new comedy special — for the first time in a very long time — and this time she's working with Netflix. \"Looks like it's been 15 years since you did a stand-up special. ...

Between 1990 and 2000, Cruise won three Golden Globe awards and earned three Academy Award nominations for his performances in \"Born on the Fourth of July,\" \"Jerry Maguire\" and \"Magnolia.\"But Cruise soon ran amok of the tabloids after a high-profile marriage and divorce from Nicole Kidman, another high-profile marriage and divorce from Katie Holmes, an angry screed about the evil of psychiatry and that whole Scientology thing. It took a few years, but Cruise is finally getting his career back on track, by embracing the action movies that made him a star with franchises including \"Jack Reacher,\" \"Mission: Impossible\" and this summer's \"The Mummy.\"Kelly McGillis ImageCharacter: CharlieCruise's love interest in the film, an astrophysicist and civilian Topgun instructor, was played by McGillis, who had risen to prominence the year before in \"Witness\" with Harrison Ford, for which she received a Golden Globe nomination.Though McGillis would go on to star in \"The Accused\" with Jodie Foster, a harrowing drama about the aftermath of a brutal gang rape, her career quickly dwindled into roles in TV movies. McGillis was going through her own struggles in her personal life; after two failed marriages, she revealed that she was a lesbian in 2009.

After playing Iceman, Kilmer moved on to projects such as \"Willow,\" \"The Doors\" and \"Tombstone\" before being tapped to play the caped crusader in Joel Schumacher's \"Batman Forever.\"Portraying the third-best modern Batman on film (ranked: Christian Bale, Michael Keaton, Kilmer, George Clooney, Ben Affleck) seemed to stall Kilmer’s career somewhat. He nonetheless pulled out great performances in \"Heat\" and \"Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang.\"And then there was some weirdness last year when Michael Douglas claimed Kilmer had oral cancer, which Kilmer denied, until several weeks ago when Kilmer claimed to have had \"a healing of cancer.\"No word yet on what, precisely, that means.Anthony Edwards ImageCharacter: GooseSince 1986: Edwards was perfect as affable wingman Goose in \"Top Gun,\" but it wasn't until his transition to television that his career really took off. The heart of early seasons of NBC's \"ER,\" Edwards played Dr. Mark Greene, who meets an intensely tear-jerking end that rivals even Goose's demise. What has Edwards been up to since he departed \"ER\" in 2002?

Fifteen minutes later Cornell was in his hotel room, the report said, where bodyguard Martin Kirsten (who used to work for and date Heidi Klum) helped him fix his computer and gave him two Ativan. At 11:35 p.m. Cornell was talking to his wife, Vicky, who said Friday through her attorney that she had been concerned because her husband was slurring his words and told her he might have taken a few too many anxiety pills. She called Kirsten at 12:15 a.m. Thursday and asked him to check on the singer, the report said; the bodyguard kicked in the hotel room door, then the locked bathroom door, and found Cornell. At his final show, Cornell seemed \"high\" and \"was out of character from note 1,\" lead sound engineer Ted Keedick told TMZ in an interview published Wednesday.

TweetThe original \"Top Gun\" came out in 1986 and Cruise played a cocky Navy aviator hungry to be the best of the best when he enters the competitive Topgun program based at the Naval Air Station in Miramar, Calif.The film featured a lot of male posturing, a strangely erotic beach volleyball scene and, like, a lot of Kenny Loggins songs. TweetGiven that literally nothing else is known about the film at this point, let's enter into a bit of reality-based speculation. There are a number of challenges to making a sequel to a film that was released more than 30 years ago. For starters, all of those actors playing beautiful, young fighter pilots are now, well, a lot older. Then there are the facts. Assuming that Cruise's character, Maverick, stayed on the straight and narrow, he should have risen through the Navy ranks to a level that doesn't see him regularly flying.Further, if his rebel ways continued and he didn't rise in command, then he likely would have been asked to leave after serving for 20 years or so. At best, fans will be looking at Cruise to take on something like Tom Skerritt's sage-advisor role from the original film. He'll probably end up trying to shepherd a renegade pilot too much like himself, played by Ansel Elgort or Josh Hutcherson. There's also the matter that Miramar isn't even a Naval Air Station anymore, transferring to the Marine Corps in 1999.Not to worry, however, the Topgun program still exists; it's just located in beautiful Fallon, Nev., now.

We turn there for the satirical distance and perspective that might allow us to process the day and get to sleep – for laughs when laughter is appropriate, but also for a thoughtful response when events go beyond ordinary human folly to the terrible and unthinkable.Monday's suicide bombing after an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, was on the minds of some late-night hosts Tuesday night.\"There's really nothing you can say that can approach the shock and the grief of the victims and their families,\" said Stephen Colbert on \"Late Show,\" asking his audience to go online to hear what his CBS colleague James Corden, who follows him on \"The Late Late Show,\" had to say the night before.\"All we can add here,\" said Colbert, \"is that following acts of senseless violence like this, it's all the more important not to be controlled by fear, but instead to be reminded by the action of people of Manchester who rushed to the aid of their friends and strangers alike. It is just more proof that evil cannot succeed as long as good people are willing to love each other.\"On NBC's \"Late Night,\" host Seth Meyers had similar thoughts.\"At its best, being at a concert is an incredible collective experience,\" he said. \"It's a chance through a shared love of music to connect with, to sing with and to dance with people you don't know.... And so this comes down to the way we treat strangers, and while some cowards chose to treat strangers with hate, from everything I read, Manchester was filled with people last night who provided aid and comfort to help victims who were total strangers to them.\"He ended with a \"plea for all of us to not need a tragedy to remind us of the importance of treating those we do not know with love instead of hate.\"The Irish band U2, in Los Angeles to perform concerts of their own, were among Jimmy Kimmel's guests on ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\" Kimmel brought up Manchester.\"I imagine that is something you guys have been thinking about,\" he said.\"They hate music, they hate women, they even hate little girls – they hate everything that we love,\" lead singer Bono replied. \"The worst of humanity was on view in Manchester last night – but so was the best, as people took perfect strangers into their houses and queued up for blood banks.

Get the work. And she's great.\"She did, however, caution her dancers that in a year, she would be back on a record cycle, so if they wanted to rejoin her, they needed to build in a 30-day contingency in their contract. After the year passed, Perry contacted the dancers, whom she was \"very close with,\" and let them know she was readying a new tour. They replied that they'd contact management and were subsequently fired from Swift's tour. Perry's story, up to this point, seems to jibe with what had previously been pieced together from various interviews.A 2013 interview from Examiner featured one of the dancers in question, who confirmed that he and two other backup dancers who had previously worked on Perry's \"California Dreams\" tour departed Swift's tour to join Perry's \"Prism\" tour. This also vaguely aligns with a 2014 Rolling Stone interview wherein Swift confirmed that her hit single \"Bad Blood\" was about a fellow female artist she had a falling out with.\"She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I'm surprisingly nonconfrontational – you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It's awkward, and I don't like it,\" Swift told the magazine.This may or may not be where Swift and Perry's narratives diverge. After the dancers returned to her, Perry claims she reached out to Swift in an attempt to discuss the matter, and Swift refused.\"I do the right thing any time that it feels like a fumble,\" Perry told Corden.\"So you did the phone call and it was a shutdown,\" Corden clarified.\"It was a full shutdown and then she writes this song ['Bad Blood'] about me,\" Perry continued.However, at Corden's probing, Perry conceded that if Swift were to text her to say, in Corden's words, \"the beef is off the grill,\" that she would, in return, take the beef off the grill.\"I think that women together and not divided and without any of this petty [stuff] — women together will heal the world,\" Perry concluded.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:51:34.129Z","datePublished":"2017-05-23T18:47:00.000Z","headline":"Katy Perry confirms it: She and Taylor Swift indeed have bad blood","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Libby Hill"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#katy-perry-confirms-it-she-and-taylor-swift-indeed-have-bad-blood"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"VideoThere was a disturbance in the force Tuesday morning when Vanity Fair released its \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" covers photographed by Annie Leibovitz.Tagged \"The Force,\" \"The Dark Side,\" \"The Resistance\" and \"The Legacy,\" the covers were broken down into four categories, each featuring the stars of the upcoming film.

Not that anyone needed reminding, in light of the heightened security measures up and down the Croisette: the constant presence of armed police officers, the large planters lining the streets to protect against a vehicular attack, and the metal detectors set up at every entrance to the Palais des Festivals.The festival had already weathered one false alarm on Friday, when a “suspicious object” that had been left behind in one of the screening rooms triggered a bomb scare. The Palais was evacuated, delaying by 45 minutes the first press screening of “Redoubtable,” Michel Hazanavicius’ film about the filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard. Less than a year ago, the driver of a 19-ton truck attacked members of the crowd celebrating Bastille Day on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, about 20 miles from Cannes, leaving 86 dead and more than 430 injured.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:53:28.527Z","datePublished":"2017-05-23T16:15:00.000Z","headline":"Amid tight security, Cannes pauses for a moment of silence to honor Manchester victims","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1f26279/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F66%2F98%2Fbe31fc6a7d232d2b3a34d8813ed4%2Fla-1495552786-lkzccwde7p-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Justin Chang"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#amid-tight-security-cannes-pauses-for-a-moment-of-silence-to-honor-manchester-victims"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThere is much confusion in the aftermath of the Manchester terrorist attack that left 22 dead and more than 50 injured at an Ariana Grande concert Monday night.

Times confirmed that Zack Snyder is stepping away from finishing the upcoming “Justice League” picture in the wake of the suicide of his daughter. Originally reported at the Hollywood Reporter, 20-year-old Autumn Snyder died in March.  “The demands of this job are pretty intense. It is all-consuming,” Snyder said to THR. “And in the last two months, I’ve come to the realization … I’ve decided to take a step back from the movie to be with my family, be with my kids, who really need me. They are all having a hard time. I’m having a hard time.”Stepping in for Snyder to finish the high-profile movie starring Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa will be Joss Whedon. After making two films as part of the Disney/Marvel “Avengers” series, Whedon was recently announced as joining the Warners/DC universe for an upcoming “Batgirl” movie. \"Justice League\" is still expected to make its planned Nov. 17 release date.Whedon will oversee the additional photography that had already been planned and carry the film through the end of its post-production. Snyder and Whedon are said to have a strong rapport and that Whedon is intent on seeing through Snyder's vision for the film.Snyder also said to THR that he planned to keep the matter of his daughter’s death private, but that once he decided to step away from “Justice League” he knew there would be a demand for answers.  “I knew there would be narratives created on the internet. They’ll do what they do,” Snyder said. “The truth is … I’m past caring about that kind of thing now.”Snyder added, “In the end, it’s just a movie. It’s a great movie.

Jay Pharoah, who played President Obama, was let go during the hiatus before Season 42.  Instagram Instagram Instagram","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:00:14.430Z","datePublished":"2017-05-22T21:59:00.000Z","headline":"Sasheer Zamata leaves ‘Saturday Night Live,’ leaving three black cast members","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e81a439/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2F58%2F6b7d42cc89a959eef08085417b2f%2Fla-et-mg-sasheer-zamata-is-leaving-snl-20170522","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Christie D’Zurilla"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#sasheer-zamata-leaves-saturday-night-live-leaving-three-black-cast-members"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageAfter charming comic book fans into forgetting Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield previously slung webs as Peter Parker, \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" star Tom Holland has landed his second major franchise.The 20-year-old Brit is attached to star as a young Nathan Drake in Sony Pictures' long-developing live-action 'Uncharted' movie, based on the popular Naughty Dog and PlayStation action adventure video game, Deadline reported Monday.Shawn Levy (\"Night at the Museum\") is at the helm of the Sony project that's been in development for almost a decade.The story of Drake, a globetrotting, treasure-hunting adventurer, has been through a revolving door of filmmakers over the years, including directors David O.

He then walked that hard line back: “Well, I shouldn’t say that. It would be less attractive, for sure, because it would affect [Netflix’s] festival strategy around the world.”Sarandos even gave the growing flap a cheeky nickname: \"L’Affaire de Netflix,\" quite a scandal indeed in a year with a disappointing lack of l'enfants terribles making Nazi jokes, or movie stars sporting paper bags over their heads, or any real controversy, really, on the Croisette.The conflict has divided the film world and dominated festival chatter this year at Cannes, forcing filmmakers and industry veterans to take sides in a philosophical and practical battle that cuts to the fundamental crisis of modern movie watching: traditional vs. digital distribution as battleground for the war over what really matters in the consumption, and business, of film.On Team Netflix: \"Okja\" helmer Bong, naturally, who shrugged off the press-screening projection snafu, the audience boos at the sight of Netflix's logo on the big screen, and the public shade from competition jury head Pedro Almodóvar, who last week slammed watching movies on screens \"smaller than the chair on which you're sitting.\"But when Netflix's deep pockets are increasingly financing and snapping up films that might otherwise land at traditional distributors, things get stickier. Working with Netflix was \"a wonderful experience,\" Bong enthused at his film's presser. \"The expectation is always that your film will be seen on the big screen,\" Baumbach said at Cannes days later. His \"Meyerowitz Stories\" was filmed independently on 16mm before Netflix picked it up for a streaming and limited theatrical debut.\"I believe in that; it is a unique, singular experience that is not going away,\" he said.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:52:44.256Z","datePublished":"2017-05-22T19:17:00.000Z","headline":"Netflix’s Ted Sarandos says Cannes film fest now ‘less attractive’ to streaming giant","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b91aac1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/750x422+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd5%2F69%2F9a323ff2eb1b77ad4bda5ddb8f40%2F750x422","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Jen Yamato"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#netflixs-ted-sarandos-says-cannes-film-fest-now-less-attractive-to-streaming-giant"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageSo it's the middle of May and we still don't know whether Beyoncé is carrying boys, girls or glorious beings made of pure light.

There was the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to continue said investigation and the report that a senior White House advisor has been named a person of interest in the case.And there was Trump's claim he'd been treated worse than any other politician in history -- presumably including those killed by assassins, such as Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy.\"The last seven days have been absolutely insane, so much so that they may have broken Anderson Cooper,\" Oliver said, cueing a much-discussed clip of the CNN anchor suggesting that Trump supporter Jeffrey Lord would tolerate any sort of objectionable behavior from the president. As Oliver noted, Fox News pundits such as Tucker Carlson have done their best to ignore the drip-drip of revelations, but some personalities on the network, such as Jesse Watters, haven't been able to quell all their doubts. \"A Fox host not being able to hold his doubts at bay for 48 hours is pretty much a canary in a coal mine, but then at this point Donald Trump is basically waist deep in canaries,” Oliver said.But Oliver was not exactly convinced that impeachment is imminent, particularly because Republicans control both houses of Congress.

To be the butt of monologue jokes — that's all hurtful,\" Bush said. \"Having been in the job as long as I have, I developed a fairly thick skin. My skin is definitely thicker now, and my heart is a little softer underneath it.\"But it wasn't the reaction of late-night comedians that most horrified Bush. He recounted a frantic call from his then-15-year-old daughter, Mary, in which he tried to assure her that everything would be all right. \"Why were you laughing at the things that he was saying on that bus, Dad? They weren't funny,\" Bush's daughter pressed him. \"I have no answer for that that's any good. I am really sorry. That was Dad in a bad moment a long time ago,\" Bush responded.Bush recalled that in 2005, he was often with Trump, given that \"The Apprentice\" was a monster hit. \"I spent a lot of time with Trump. He was my main assignment,\" Bush explained before explaining his ignoble behavior on the bus. \"In my job, there's a lot of downtime, and there are off-camera moments where you have a short period of time to, in a chameleon-like way, connect with people,\" Bush said. \"If it's Martha Stewart, I would tell her about the new organic garden that I just started growing in my backyard.\"Because it was Trump, Bush seemingly went along with the crass, dehumanizing discussion of women.Since his dismissal from \"Today,\" Bush has processed the events the best way he knew how.\"When you have a big, traumatic event, you go through stages, and it led to acceptance and understanding,\" mused Bush. \"And then I found myself in a place of soul searching. And I developed a commitment to become a better, fuller man.\"Bush hopes to return to television in some form and, in the meantime, he'll reach out to others who have also found themselves under intense public scrutiny. \"I will be picking up my pen and writing them and calling them on the phone, and I will pursue these interviews and these moments with these people,\" said Bush. \"And through what I've learned and where I've been, I will tell them, 'You have empathetic ears in me.'\"ALSODwayne Johnson and Tom Hanks announce 2020 candidacy on 'Saturday Night Live' season finaleFox News fires Bob Beckel from 'The Five,' claims he made insensitive remark to black employeeAfter years of silence, activists are forcing music festivals to take sexual assault seriously","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:47:57.936Z","datePublished":"2017-05-22T15:24:00.000Z","headline":"Billy Bush regrets that ‘Access Hollywood’ tape, especially his daughter’s reaction to it","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Libby Hill"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#billy-bush-regrets-that-access-hollywood-tape-especially-his-daughters-reaction-to-it"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Image QuoteFROM THE ARCHIVES: The Sunday Conversation: 'Just a 'crazy dog lady'","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:54:52.362Z","datePublished":"2017-05-22T14:45:00.000Z","headline":"A Star Is Born: Maggie Q turns 38 today","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/db21f24/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+120/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F61%2F84%2Fb818a0a743cf791216a5d796934f%2Fimg-591ee836-turbine-la-et-maggie-20170519","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Los Angeles Times Staff"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#a-star-is-born-maggie-q-turns-38-today"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageWith provocations like \"Dogtooth\" and \"The Lobster,\" director Yorgos Lanthimos has been jolting audiences at the Cannes Film Festival and beyond for nearly a decade.But even the most prepared Cannes filmgoers may not have been ready for \"The Killing of a Sacred Deer,\" the Greek-born filmmaker's latest and possibly craziest work, which premiered to reporters Monday morning at the festival.To describe the movie in too much detail is to spoil the fun. Basically, the English-language film centers on an upper-class family living a perfectly manicured, disturbingly sterile life in an unnamed American suburb — cardiologist dad and ophthalmologist mom (Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman), well-behaved pre-adolescent son and even better-behaved teenage daughter — and what happens when a mysterious teenage boy enters their lives.“What happens” isn’t easy to describe without unpacking the whole thing. Suffice it to say that in the cards are profound moral choices, themes of guilt and responsibility, and plot turns featuring illness and supernatural occurrences. But not, it should be said, in a baroque genre way — more in the chillingly slow-burn and unpredictable European vein.That class is involved adds to the weight. And like that little February fad \"Get Out,\" \"Deer\" is an indictment of white privilege in the guise of a medical horror movie (and comes in this case with a Kubrickian influence and even more dark comedy).Fest goers began debating the movie almost immediately after its debut screening — such are both its plot turns and layers of symbolic meaning. It’s a conversation that will no doubt continue and intensify when A24, the studio that put out \"Moonlight,\" releases the film in the fall.Lanthimos, meanwhile, seemed to be enjoying the back-and-forth. “I don’t like explaining what we’re doing because I don’t really know either,” he said with a small smile when a reporter at a post-screening press conference asked him to interpret one of the events in the film. “These are questions to take with you, I guess.”He did cop to the laughs as intentional. “Nicole likes to say I would tell her all the time we were shooting it [that] it was a comedy. And I believe that.”Kidman offered her own take on the director's dark vision. “The film has a hypnotic quality to it. A lot of times Yorgos' direction is, ‘Please do nothing.’ And that’s very difficult to do as an actor,” she added. “After I saw the film I called him and said ‘I’ve never seen anything like it.’”","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:55:28.035Z","datePublished":"2017-05-22T14:19:00.000Z","headline":"Why the twists in ‘The Lobster’ director’s newest film has Cannes calling it the next ‘Get Out’","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/57c6e0c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x576+0+53/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F46%2F53%2F6c00a4014213a01f86ba440a2436%2Fla-1495456926-m3pr9h9rfm-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Steven Zeitchik "}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#why-the-twists-in-the-lobster-directors-newest-film-has-cannes-calling-it-the-next-get-out"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageAfter almost 40 years, audiences are still interested in the “Alien” universe. Ridley Scott’s “Alien: Covenant,” from 20th Century Fox, dethroned Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,” which had topped the box office for two straight weeks. Meanwhile, Warner Bros.’ “Everything, Everything” and Fox’s” “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” sequel battled for those not interested in R-rated scares.“Alien” took in an estimated $36 million in the U.S. and Canada, coming in below analyst projections of $40 million to $50 million. Internationally, the picture pulled $30.3 million this weekend after already being open in territories across the globe. Its worldwide take rests at $117.8 million to date.“It does endure the test of time,” said Chris Aronson, the studio’s head of distribution, “as does Sir Ridley Scott.” VideoThe latest in the aging franchise is the eighth film, counting the two widely panned “Alien Vs. Predator” movies. It’s also a sequel to 2012’s “Prometheus,” a heady quasi-prequel to the original 1979 “Alien.” The studio was able to drum up interest in the flick among core “Alien” fans with gruesome marketing and generally positive reviews. It may also help that the the famous creatures designed by surrealist H.R. Giger -- the xenomorphs and facehuggers -- which “Prometheus” lacked because of its origin-of-man backstory, were reintroduced.Audiences (62% male; 66% 25 and older; 51% white) gave the picture a B CinemaScore; critics gave it an average 73% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes.“Alien: Covenant” performed worse than its 2012 predecessor, which brought in $51 million in its debut. That film ended up collecting $400 million worldwide. But considering the studio saved more than 25% in production costs this go around, with a $97-million price tag, the future of “Covenant’s” profitability still looks promising.Falling to second place in its third week was “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” with a still-impressive $35.1 million this weekend. It has pulled in $301.8 million domestically to date for a global tally more than $732 million.Read More","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:00:19.396Z","datePublished":"2017-05-21T18:41:00.000Z","headline":"‘Alien: Covenant’ is No. 1, but it’s not the box office monster ‘Guardians’ feared","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dd1b6f7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/750x422+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8c%2F2b%2Ffe5e4a7f3ced3b5e65b9d210023f%2F750x422","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Tre’vell Anderson"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#alien-covenant-is-no-1-but-its-not-the-box-office-monster-guardians-feared"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"It was an eventful season finale for “Saturday Night Live.” Not only did host Dwayne Johnson join the “Five-Timers Club” and announce his candidacy for president — with running mate Tom Hanks — \"SNL\" bid farewell to longtime cast members Bobby Moynihan and Vanessa Bayer.Johnson and fellow Five-Timer Hanks — on hand to help Alec Baldwin welcome The Rock to the club — reasoned that their various film roles as men of action and integrity made them a lock for 2020.The show opened with various cast members and previous guest hosts related to President Trump — including Baldwin and Scarlett Johansson returning as Donald and Ivanka, respectively, and Kate McKinnon as Kellyanne Conway-- convened around a piano.The group sang a much more comic version of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” than the one performed by McKinnon as Hillary Clinton after the election.

It’s about a young boy who, after his first Communion, celebrates by wolfing down too many sweets at a Viennese pastry shop.

But he’s never been here with a film like “Wonderstruck.”Indeed, he’s never made anything like “Wonderstruck” before.“My films are not always the most conventional,” the director, exhausted by travel but completely involved, acknowledged the night before “Wonderstruck” debuted in competition at Cannes.But with this engaging and richly emotional film, smartly adapted from Brian Selznick’s uncommon novel, he’s not only made his first-ever family film, but he’s done so very much on his own terms.“The thing that excited me was that I’d never done a movie about kids, a film kids could see,” the director says. “But I wanted it to be as complex, sophisticated and rich as any cinematic experience, to make something really sublime for kids. Great kids films are great films.” ImageIn this goal he is helped by Selznick’s enormous novel, which tells the stories, first parallel and then intertwined, of two fearless and curious 12-year-olds, who, 50 years apart, run away from home chasing big-city dreams in Manhattan.In 1977, young Ben (Oakes Fegley of the underappreciated “Pete’s Dragon”) takes off from Gunflint, Minn., for New York. In 1927, feisty Rose (newcomer Millicent Simmonds) leaves Hoboken, N.J., with the same destination in mind.But that is only the beginning of the complexities that Selznick, whose first novel became Martin Scorsese’s “Hugo,” has layered into the story.Read More","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:00:23.721Z","datePublished":"2017-05-19T19:07:00.000Z","headline":"What’s a kids film doing at Cannes?

But after completing a rehab program, he was in recovery when he and members of Rage Against the Machine formed the band Audioslave in 2001.“Chris’ death is a loss that escapes words and has created an emptiness in my heart that will never be filled,” Vicky Cornell said. “As everyone who knew him commented, Chris was a devoted father and husband. He was my best friend. His world revolved around his family first and of course, his music, second.“He flew home for Mother’s Day to spend time with our family,” she said. “He flew out midday Wednesday, the day of the show, after spending time with the children. When we spoke before the show, we discussed plans for a vacation over Memorial Day and other things we wanted to do .... “The outpouring of love and support from his fans, friends and family means so much more to us than anyone can know,” her statement concluded. “Thank you for that, and for understanding how difficult this is for us.”Read More","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:56:55.277Z","datePublished":"2017-05-19T16:05:00.000Z","headline":"Chris Cornell’s wife says suicide ‘inexplicable’ and suspects medication might have contributed","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/be06570/2147483647/strip/true/crop/750x422+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F4b%2Fd0769c360447452e0d38f5a47555%2F750x422","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Randy Lewis"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#chris-cornells-wife-says-suicide-inexplicable-and-suspects-medication-might-have-contributed"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageSometimes a film festival holds up a mirror to the world’s harshest realities, and sometimes it provides a welcome respite from them.On Thursday, amid what felt like an unceasing wave of news alerts from the U.S. — the unexpected deaths of Roger Ailes and Chris Cornell, a fatal car crash in Times Square, the latest developments in the Trump-Russia saga — the Cannes Film Festival saw fit to unveil two pictures notable for their exquisite loveliness, their enchanting good vibes and their sweet yet tough-minded suggestion that everything might turn out just fine in the end.Needless to say, neither of the films in question was directed by Michael Haneke, even if his latest picture does bear the (presumably ironic) title “Happy End.” (It will screen for the press on Sunday.)Instead, festivalgoers queued up amid heightened security for the first screenings of Todd Haynes’ “Wonderstruck,” which premiered in the main competition, and Claire Denis’ “Let the Sunshine In” (“Un Beau Soleil Intérieur”), which opened the parallel Directors’ Fortnight sidebar.Read More","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:46:31.800Z","datePublished":"2017-05-19T15:43:00.000Z","headline":"Justin Chang’s Cannes diary: The optimism of ‘Wonderstruck’ and ‘Let the Sunshine In’","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/85043ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/850x478+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc1%2Fc4%2Fd55dfd3450d0a354240806469be5%2F850x478","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Justin Chang"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#justin-changs-cannes-diary-the-optimism-of-wonderstruck-and-let-the-sunshine-in"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageWhen Leon Vitali was working on Stanley Kubrick's \"Full Metal Jacket,\" he became involved in a disagreement with the director over the size of cabins in the shoot.\"I got a phone call at eight o'clock. 'Your measurements are off by miles,'\" Vitali, Kubrick's longtime aide-de-camp and subject of the new documentary \"Filmworker,\" recalled the director telling him.\"It was '… Leon … Leon … Leon, you are off,'\" Vitali continued, repeating Kubrick’s choice of obscenity. \"I said '… Stanley … Stanley … Stanley. I am not.' Ten minutes later, Stanley called back and said, 'I'm sorry.

Far less recognized is the person who helped him carry out that exactitude, and endured some of its harshest consequences. QuoteFor nearly a quarter-century since \"Barry Lyndon,\" Vitali — a successful British TV actor earlier in his career — served as Kubrick's right-hand man. After starring as Lord Bullingdon in the 1975 period piece, Vitali shifted roles to work behind the scenes on signature Kubrick movies such as \"The Shining,\" \"Full Metal Jacket\" and \"Eyes Wide Shut.\"When \"Filmworker\" premieres Friday at the Cannes Film Fes‎tival, it will offer a fitting addition to this cinephile gathering. The Tony Zierra-directed documentary is, in part, a profile in absentia of Kubrick, one of moviedom's most studied and at times misunderstood masters.But by spotlighting Vitali, an insanely devoted man who lived in that master's shadow, it also illuminates a unique picture of creativity and its costs. Hollywood biopics can pull a muscle trying to tell us the crazed devotion that art requires. \"Filmworker\" effortlessly shows it.To explain Vitali's job is to try to trace the path of a worker ant. The best description might be 'The Kubrick Whisperer.” At various points the diminutive Brit was — unofficially and often unexpectedly — a casting agent, an editor, a title translator, an on-set manual laborer, a foreign-license negotiator, a color-corrector, an actor workshopper and a marketing advisor. And a dozen other jobs that came up as needed, all because Kubrick trusted only him to handle them. (It was, for instance, Vitali who found Danny Lloyd, who played young Danny Torrance in \"The Shining.\")Read More","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:46:56.801Z","datePublished":"2017-05-19T15:36:00.000Z","headline":"Sharing a Coke and memories at Cannes with Kubrick whisperer Leon Vitali","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3ea29c5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1b%2F5a%2F04d4b858322e1144fd0bafc36498%2Fla-1495208836-x6p97dyhpl-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Steven Zeitchik "}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#sharing-a-coke-and-memories-at-cannes-with-kubrick-whisperer-leon-vitali"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageTilda Swinton has long been a sought-after star at Cannes, not only because of her versatile talent but because she always seems to be be living smarter, easier, cooler than the rest of us.Such qualities were on display Friday, when at a news conference for her new film \"Okja\"— which contains pro-organic, anti-capitalist undercurrents in its story about a lovable, genetically modified pig — she offered a prescription for Life According to Tilda.

At the sight of the streaming giant's logo in the opening credits Friday, a number of viewers began booing.  When the film began, the projection was misaligned to cut off half of the actors' faces, prompting the audience to hoot and holler. The chaotic spectacle went on for several minutes until the movie was stopped and the problem corrected.Such technical glitches happen (very) occasionally at the methodically run Cannes. But they came with an extra charge here because of the controversy concerning Netflix movies — which increasingly skip theatrical releases — at the traditionalist fest. Organizers first admitted two Netflix movies (Noah Baumbach's latest is the other), then, after a backlash from French theater owners, said that in the future it will bar any movies from competition that don't have French theatrical distribution.The controversy deepened Wednesday when competition-jury president Pedro Almodovar criticized Netflix, saying the screen for films \"should not be smaller than the chair on which you're sitting.\"At a news conference, Bong took the expected pro-Netflix stance, saying he \"loved\" working with the company, citing its willingness to authorize a higher budget and calling it \"a wonderful experience.\" He avoided addressing his feelings about his movie largely staying out of theaters and also steered clear of criticizing the man who held the movie's Cannes fate in his hands.\"I'm just very happy he will watch this movie [at the premiere] tonight,\" he said of the Almodovar comments. \"He can say anything; I'm fine‎.\"  “Okja” star Tilda Swinton also weighed in on the Almodovar remark. “It’s really important the president feels free to make any statement he or she wants … but if you want to know what I really think — there’s room for everybody,” she said.Bong was also asked about \"rumors\" the opening was \"sabotaged\" by anti-Netflix forces. He laughed. \"I'm happy.

He also emphasized the network's relatively young audience, with a median viewer age of 45 on linear television, 34 for video on demand, and just 26 for digital. \"The CW has evolved from a linear to a broadcast digital hybrid into a true multi-platform success,\" Pedowitz said. The little network that could previewed two new dramas for fall. \"Valor,\" starring Matt Barr and Christina Ochoa, is a military thriller about elite helicopter pilots.  \"Dynasty\" is a reboot of the '80s primetime soap from \"Gossip Girl\" creators Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage.The update promises a more diverse cast and less voluminous hair than the original -- but plenty of dishy salaciousness and glamorous bickering. A clip in which the new Fallon Carrington (Elizabeth Gillies) takes a swing at her stepmom-to-be Cristal Jennings (Nathalie Kelley) and tells her to \"bite me\" drew an enthusiastic reaction from the crowd of ad buyers. The network also repeatedly touted the diversity of its lineup, which will expand in the season ahead with \"Dynasty\" as well as the midseason drama \"Black Lightning,\" about a black superhero and his family. Introduced by Pedowitz, \"Jane The Virgin\" star Gina Rodriguez delivered heartfelt remarks about the importance of \"shows that reflect what America truly looks like.\"  \"Television has the power to bring someone into your living room you might not have had to meet otherwise, which is pretty dope, right?\" she said, noting the network's five female-led series. \"The CW uses its platform to build bridges of understanding through inclusion and equality.\"The stars of one of those female-led shows, \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,\" also made an appearance. Rachel Bloom, Vincent Rodriguez III and Donna Lynne Champlin sang a disco-inspired number, \"We'll Never Have Problems Again,\" from the low-rated but critically beloved series. Also on the horizon for the 2017-18 season are an animated Scooby-Doo crossover episode of the long-running \"Supernatural,\" and the midseason drama \"Life Sentence,\" starring Lucy Hale as a young woman whose life is upended when she finds out she's not dying of cancer.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:02:26.203Z","datePublished":"2017-05-18T18:45:00.000Z","headline":"CW showcases diversity, youth -- and catfights! -- at upfront","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Meredith Blake"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#cw-showcases-diversity-youth-and-catfights-at-upfront"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageRight from his earliest days as lead singer of Soundgarden, it seemed as if Chris Cornell had come from central casting for rock-and-roll lead singer, a lean, long-haired sex god with an expressively outsized voice.As there was always something so panoramic about his singing, it was a natural progression for Cornell’s music to make its way to the big screen.Cornell earned a Golden Globe nomination in 2012 for the song “The Keeper” from the little-remembered Gerard Butler action-drama “Machine Gun Preacher.” That song found Cornell in a fairly straightforward singer-songwriter mode that didn’t quite capture his particular gifts.Much better was the song “Seasons,” which he contributed to Cameron Crowe’s 1992 romantic comedy “Singles,” based on the Seattle music scene. Lightly psychedelic, tinged with the folkier side of Led Zeppelin (to which he was so often compared), the song brings out the more soulful side of Cornell’s persona. (Crowe has said he once considered Cornell for the role that eventually went to Matt Dillon. Cornell nevertheless made a cameo appearance.)It was his song for the first James Bond picture starring Daniel Craig, 2006’s “Casino Royale,” that would prove to be Cornell’s greatest contribution to a movie. Co-written with the film’s composer. David Arnold, \"You Know My Name\" placed Cornell in a new context, where the theatrical bombast and throaty rumble of his singing made for a surprisingly good fit.If “Casino Royale” was meant to be a rougher reboot of the Bond franchise, casting Cornell in the role of a grunge Shirley Bassey, finding the grit rubbing against the glamour, was unexpectedly inspired.Even as he continued touring and putting out albums, Cornell was often drawn back to contributing songs for movies. Cornell sang the title song to the recently released film “The Promise,” starring Christian Bale and Oscar Isaac.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:54:42.395Z","datePublished":"2017-05-18T17:28:00.000Z","headline":"Chris Cornell found another home for his music in movies","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/87db097/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F86%2Ffe%2Fef9a933c24d31a9dbef37bcb7a11%2Fla-et-mn-chris-cornell-20170518","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Mark Olsen"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#chris-cornell-found-another-home-for-his-music-in-movies"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageThe reach of Chris Cornell's voice was not merely to the back of any stadium, theater or nightclub.

It comes from executive producers Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, the team behind \"Gossip Girl\" and \"The O.C.\" -- \"two of the most iconic soaps of the 2000s,\" as Pedowitz put it. Esther and John Shapiro, creators of the original series, are also involved as executive producers.

It's little wonder: The most-watched network has also had the most-watched late-night show since January. \"If you think that I love Stephen more now just because he's No. 1, you're right,\" joked CBS Chairman Les Moonves. \"Who would have predicted Stephen Colbert would be winning late night on CBS and Bill O'Reilly would be doing a podcast in his underwear?\" The presentation began with a top-hatted Colbert doing a choreographed song-and-dance routine about the magic of CBS' lineup. He also delivered a brief topical monologue, noting \"The Late Show's\" ratings rise, riffing on the scandal consuming the new administration and -- lest we forget the purpose of the evening -- plugging his network's lineup. Colbert likened his task to that of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. \"I'm just going to say whatever my boss told me to, and when it's over I'll leave without answering any of your questions.\" He name-checked the \"hot new star of 'Criminal Minds,' James Comey -- every season is just him writing stuff down and getting fired.\"And in response to President Trump, who criticized Colbert for using coarse language because kids might be watching, he quipped: \"Who says only old people watch CBS?\" \"There's only one word to describe this president, and the FCC has asked me not to use it anymore,\" he said. Following Colbert onstage, Moonves also made light of the controversy -- read: free publicity -- surrounding the comedian's recent use of a controversial insult to describe Trump, joking that \"The Late Show\" was especially popular with \"FCC investigators 18 to 49.\"    ","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:51:05.928Z","datePublished":"2017-05-18T00:21:00.000Z","headline":"Most-watched Stephen Colbert is the star of the show at CBS upfront","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/78b146a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+104/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F60%2Fb3%2Fd6c0e4982a12a118618a69c1b239%2Fla-1495054267-ik3qnz4d07-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Meredith Blake"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#most-watched-stephen-colbert-is-the-star-of-the-show-at-cbs-upfront"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageCBS is bringing back James Corden to host the Grammy Awards in 2018, the Los Angeles Times has confirmed. When Corden hosted the 2017 Grammys in February, the host of \"The Late Late Show\" was generally well-received as he brought comedy — including a \"Carpool Karaoke\" rendition of \"Sweet Caroline\" — into the mix. LL Cool J did the honors at the performance-heavy awards show for five years prior.

The series will also come with its own post-show wrap-up, \"Talking Trek.\"\"Star Trek: Discovery\" will premiere this fall.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:58:34.129Z","datePublished":"2017-05-17T21:30:00.000Z","headline":"First trailer for ‘Star Trek: Discovery’ brings Vulcans, Klingons and space discovery back to TV","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6e4b453/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1734x975+0+178/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F70%2F25%2F4baa8e36e14421945e0a14d6f6b5%2Fla-et-st-star-trek-discovery-20170517","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Chris Barton"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#first-trailer-for-star-trek-discovery-brings-vulcans-klingons-and-space-discovery-back-to-tv"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageUnivision Communications on Tuesday touted plans to boost prime-time ratings with a slate of edgier shows, including a second season of its “El Chapo” drug-thug drama.The nation’s leading Spanish-language media company pitched new shows to advertisers in New York in a bid to win a bigger slice of the estimated $18-billion television advertising pie that is up for grabs during the industry’s springtime ad sales auction, called the upfronts.In the past, New York-based Univision shied away from shows about drug lords, called narco-dramas, because its minority owner and programming partner Grupo Televisa of Mexico did not want to offend the Mexican government — or glorify drug traffickers.Read More","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:53:11.448Z","datePublished":"2017-05-17T19:29:00.000Z","headline":"Univision touts its rebound from ratings struggles","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/759da51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/650x366+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8a%2F58%2F52506259a4bcbab97a9982153dfd%2F650x366","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Meg James"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#univision-touts-its-rebound-from-ratings-struggles"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageHBO has tapped comedian and director Jordan Peele to adapt Matt Ruff's horror novel \"Lovecraft Country\" with \"Underground\" showrunner Misha Green.The \"Key & Peele\" co-creator, who is basking in the success of his clever horror satire \"Get Out,\" is going back to television by teaming up with J.J.

Filmmaker Ron Howard will also return as narrator and executive producer.\"Whew! I can finally answer the question… Hell yes! Warming up my uncredited narrator vocal chords,\" Howard said in the statement. \"Now the only thing I will have to be coy about is all the craziness the Bluths are going to face this season.\"The fan favorite was among Netflix's early efforts in original content programming and was the first series resurrected by the streaming service after its original run ended on broadcast television. The situation comedy was canceled by Fox after its third season and revived by Netflix for Season 4 in 2013, attracting new viewers to the evolving online service and fueling subscriber growth. Coordinating the actors' busy schedules was partially to blame for the delay, so for Season 4, Hurwitz creatively focused each episode around a different character, which resulted in less ensemble interaction than previous seasons and a bit of criticism from fans who were hoping to see the cast all together.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:54:20.015Z","datePublished":"2017-05-17T15:55:00.000Z","headline":"‘Arrested Development’ officially returning to Netflix in 2018","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8b06ac4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+216/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F14%2F9e%2F328ad34f8ddd5e738568a7fc9018%2Flat-cindy-celeb-la0009498070-20130502","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Nardine Saad"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#arrested-development-officially-returning-to-netflix-in-2018"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Forget sharing secrets with Russia.

The Weinsteins' acquisition of the flick marks a re-teaming of the trio, as Moore's \"Fahrenheit 9/11,\" about the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, was also distributed by them (and set a $200-million worldwide record for the biggest-grossing documentary of all time). Moore made headlines just weeks before the election by filming a doc in 11 days and releasing it in New York, Los Angeles and on digital platforms. It was titled \"TrumpLand\" and aimed at the \"depressed Hillary voter.\"While there is no word if \"11/9\" will feature any of the same footage, the studio says it's \"expected to be key in dissolving Trump's 'Teflon' shield and, in turn, his presidency.\"\"No matter what you throw at him, it hasn't worked,\" Moore said in a statement. \"No matter what is revealed, he remains standing. Facts, reality, brains cannot defeat him. Even when he commits a self-inflicted wound, he gets up the next morning and keeps going and tweeting.\"That all ends with this movie.\"The Weinsteins added: “There is no greater part of what we can do right now than to have the power to bring Michael Moore to a mass audience. When we had the opportunity to work with him on 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' we were so persistent that we ultimately had to part ways from Disney and we lost our beloved Miramax, named after our parents, because we believed so strongly in the message.\"The movie broke all records then, and we plan to do so again. This movie will have one of the most innovative distribution plans ever,\" the statement continued. \"Now more than ever, Michael’s appetite for the truth is crucial. We are ecstatic to be a part of this revolution.”No release date is set as of yet, but TWC's COO David Glasser is shopping the film this week in Cannes, where \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" won the coveted Palme D’or in 2004.

This week, the Olympic gold medalist learned that perfection doesn't win you mirror-ball trophies. Biles was eliminated from Monday night's episode of \"DWTS,\" failing to make it to the season finale, despite earning perfect scores from the judges on both of her dances. How could this happen? Pretty easily, it turns out. While the judges' points matter, they don't matter as much as you might think. And don't underestimate the audience vote. Here's how it works:Each of the four remaining contestants — Biles, former baseball player David Ross, Fifth Harmony member Normani Kordei and NFL running back Rashad Jennings — were judged on their two dances and given numeric scores, with a maximum of 40.BilesJive: 40Rumba: 40Total: 80JenningsRumba: 38Quickstep: 39Total: 77KordeiWaltz: 36Jazz: 40Total: 76RossFoxtrot: 34Tango: 36Total: 70The totals were then used to calculate the overall percentage of the judges' points each couple earned. (Confused yet?) Since the judges awarded 303 total points Monday night, the breakdown looked like this:Biles: 80/303 = 26.4%Jennings: 77/303 = 25.4%Kordei: 76/303 = 25.1%Ross: 70/303 = 23.1%Those percentages are then added to the percentage of overall North American viewer votes each contestant receives. If those votes had broken evenly, then it would be Biles, Jennings and Kordei moving to next week's finals. Since Biles dropped from first to last with the addition of audience votes, that means that Ross earned more than 3% more of the viewer votes than the Olympian. TweetSo what caused \"DWTS\" fans to turn on Biles?It's possible that last week's \"smile\" exchange -- during which host Tom Bergeron interjected during Biles' judging, \"I was waiting for you to smile at some of the compliments; you didn’t,\" followed by Biles' tart retort -- left a bad taste in viewers' mouths.Telling a woman to smile is treacherous territory, but perhaps some in the \"DWTS\" audience were put off by Biles' refusal to embrace Bergeron's critique. Or maybe viewers just love to see a former baseball player dance.The final \"Dancing With the Stars\" performances of

team,” academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs said in a statement.  “Mike and Jennifer produced a beautiful show that was visually stunning. And Jimmy proved, from his opening monologue all the way through a finale we could never have imagined, that he is one of our finest hosts in Oscar history.”“Hosting the Oscars was a highlight of my career and I am grateful to Cheryl, [academy CEO] Dawn [Hudson] and the academy for asking me to return to work with two of my favorite people, Mike De Luca and Jennifer Todd,” Kimmel said in his own statement. “If you think we screwed up the ending this year, wait until you see what we have planned for the 90th anniversary show!”  For the academy, the announcement of the host and producers came months ahead of the typical schedule, perhaps indicating a desire to show steadiness and continuity in the wake of the embarrassing and chaotic snafu that capped February's Oscars telecast, in which the wrong winner for best picture was initially announced.Ratings for this year's show dipped for the third straight year, but, despite the last-minute bungle, Kimmel's hosting and the overall production received largely positive reviews.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:54:10.044Z","datePublished":"2017-05-16T16:02:00.000Z","headline":"Jimmy Kimmel set to return as host for next year’s Oscars","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1d0f113/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+142/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F36%2Fe3%2Fcd8c287bffbc701a242dc51b4ea3%2Fimg-58b38c33-turbine-la-et-mn-oscars-2017-show-highlights-pictures-009","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Josh Rottenberg"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#jimmy-kimmel-set-to-return-as-host-for-next-years-oscars"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageFor a short period on Monday night, a large projection appeared on the facade of the Trump International Hotel in Washington that read “Emoluments Welcome,” along with an animation of the flags of nations where President Trump has business projects.This was followed by a message that read “Pay Trump Bribes Here,” with an arrow that pointed to the front door of the hotel.

The Fox NFL lineup and MLB rights got a lot of stage time talk.But music even infused the sports part of the presentation, with Terry Bradshaw and his \"NFL Sunday\" cohorts taking the stage to do a football parody of Bruno Mars' \"24K Magic.\"Sports talk aside, Fox spent much of its time in a musical state of mind.Longtime Fox collaborator Seth MacFarlane (\"Family Guy\"), whose new sci-fi dramedy \"The Orville\" launches in the fall, opened the entertainment part of the program with a Frank Sinatra-esque comedic number — complete with an orchestra — before introducing Fox TV Group chiefs Dana Walden and Gary Newman as \"the only people at Fox who haven't been sued.\"In previewing the 2017-18 schedule, Walden and Newman went straight to touting Wednesday's music takeover with a double dose of Lee Daniels' dramas with \"Empire\" and \"Star.\" Last season, \"Star\" went into rotation during \"Empire's\" break.

It got elected president,” said Meyers, who also joked that “someone had to revive Mike Pence” after he heard about the network’s upcoming revival of “Will & Grace”He said that the upfronts -- an annual ritual in which networks put a sometimes desperate spin on their ratings and shamelessly plug soon-to-be-forgotten shows -- have been “post-truth from the beginning.”“This week is the definition of fake news,” he said.But Meyers didn’t have to make up any numbers when boasting about his former home, “Saturday Night Live,” which like “Late Night” has benefitted from the appetite for Trump-related humor.\"Saturday Night Live’ is having one of its highest rated seasons in history,” he said. “That always feels good to hear, 'Hey, ever since you left, we started watching.' It’s like if I found out my dad is going to Little League games now.\"Meyers was the only late night star from NBC to appear at Radio City. “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon, who opened last year’s upfront with a “Hamilton”-inspired performance, did not make an appearance onstage this time around.Meyers also noted the success of “This Is Us,” last season’s No. 1 new drama and a full-blown cultural phenomenon.“‘This Is Us’ is the first NBC show in 13 years to be the top-rated program of the week, so maybe a better name for it would be 'This Is Unlike Us,'\" he said, likening NBC’s promotion of the show to “the way a girl shows off the diamond on her engagement ring.”In truth, NBC was relatively restrained in its promotion of “This Is Us,” waiting a full 90 minutes before sharing a video of cast members surprising misty-eyed fans as they talked about their personal connection to the show.The Season 2 hints were scarce, though star Mandy Moore promised it will “move you and probably make you cry.” (Well, duh.)NBC also gave its revival of “Will & Grace” a place of honor near the beginning the presentation, with stars Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Megan Mullally and Sean Hayes performing “As If We Never Said Goodbye” from the musical “Sunset Boulevard.\"But NBC’s primetime lineup was but a small portion of the marathon presentation, which for the second year in a row combined a dizzying array of content from all of NBCUniversal’s networks, including Bravo, E!, USA, CNBC, Syfy and Telemundo, in a single pitch to advertisers and media buyers.Among the cavalcade of stars who also graced the stage were Khloe and Kim Kardashian, plugging their little sister Kylie Jenner’s new E! series, “Life of Kylie,” and Bravo personalities Andy Cohen and Bethenny Frankel.There was also a preview of the rebranded Oxygen, which is shifting to focus solely on true crime series, but keeping the now-ironic name.\"What’s great about today is it’s not just about NBC,” Meyers said. “It’s about an entire family of channels. NBCUniversal is home to the Golf Channel and Bravo, the two channels most often watched in different rooms of the same house.\"","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:02:09.839Z","datePublished":"2017-05-15T19:14:00.000Z","headline":"Seth Meyers brings some edge to NBCUniversal’s marathon upfront presentation","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b17657b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fed%2F08%2F05928ef7c23ea71dffde7d5986a4%2Fla-1494870114-04vwk1x8at-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Meredith Blake"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#seth-meyers-brings-some-edge-to-nbcuniversals-marathon-upfront-presentation"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageOutfest, Los Angeles' LGBTQ film festival, announced Monday plans to honor prolific writer-producer Bryan Fuller during the 10-day festival happening July 6-16.It also revealed its gala screenings, including Francis Lee's \"God's Own Country,\" \"Behind the Curtain: Todrick Hall\" and Trudie Styler’s comedic \"Freak Show.\"This year is the 35th anniversary of the festival, a moment to be celebrated, said Executive Director Christopher Racster.\"What started as a three-day media conference on the campus of UCLA is now a year-round organization with global impact,\" he said in a statement. \"Outfest Los Angeles remains ahead of the curve in showcasing the work and stories of women, people of color and the trans community.\"When I look at the galas for this year's Outfest Los Angeles, I can see that impact and leadership — with incredible efforts by female directors, the international discussion around trans rights and the dignity in their stories, and the spotlight on new avenues of storytelling to get stories out,\" Racster added.Fuller will be honored on the festival's opening night with the Achievement Award, the organization's highest honor presented to someone whose body of work has made significant contributions to queer film and media.

Miss New Jersey Chhavi Verg was the runner-up, and Miss Minnesota Meridith Gould came in third place.Naples-born McCullough dazzled judges Julianne Hough, Ashley Graham and Terrence Jenkins -- and piqued social media interest -- with her answers in the Q&A portion of the competition, which covered healthcare, social media, women’s rights and issues facing teenagers. When asked if she thinks affordable healthcare is a right or a privilege for U.S. citizens, McCullough said it was a \"definitely\" a privilege. \"As a government employee, I am granted healthcare. And I see firsthand that for one to have healthcare, you need to have jobs,\" she said. \"So therefore, we need to continue to cultivate this environment that we’re given the opportunities to have healthcare as well as jobs to all the American citizens worldwide.”The answer raised the ire of social media, as well as her denouncement of feminism. Tweet\"As a woman scientist in the government, I’d like to lately transpose the word feminism to equalism,” she said when asked what she thinks feminism is and if she considers herself a feminist. The audience loudly cheered her response,  according to the Washington Post.“I don’t really want to consider myself — try not to consider myself like this diehard, you know, like, ‘Oh, I don’t really care about men.’ But one thing I’m gonna say, though, is women, we are just as equal as men when it comes to opportunity in the workplace,\" she continued. \"And I say firsthand: I have witnessed the impact that women have in leadership in the medical sciences, as well as just in the office environment.\"She also said that as Miss USA, she \"would hope to promote that type of leadership responsibility globally.\"McCullough, one of five contestants who immigrated to the U.S. as youngsters and are now citizens, took the crown from Army officer Deshauna Barber, also from the District of Columbia.Barber won the Miss USA title last year in the aftermath of host Steve Harvey's infamous Miss Universe gaffe and the departure of former pageant owner Donald Trump after NBCUniversal and Univision ousted him for offending Latinos during his White House run.McCullough will go on to compete on the Miss Universe pageant.The Associated Press contributed to this report.ALSO'Spicy' returns

confetti and dashed singing dreams had barely been swept off the stage of \"American Idol\" before ABC announced last week its decision to resurrect the long-running Fox franchise for the 2017-18 season.The revival had many perplexed, though not entirely surprised. Talks about the return of \"American Idol,\" which wrapped its 15-season run on Fox just last year,  have been swirling for months, with NBC in the running as a possible home at one point.“American Idol” premiered on Fox in 2002 and quickly became a ratings powerhouse for the network. At its peak, the singing competition series drew an average of 30 million viewers a week.  Even as its viewership dropped considerably in its later seasons — to about 9 million viewers — such numbers are coveted in a fractured media landscape, particularly for ABC.Of the show's move to ABC, Fox Television Group co-chairman Dana Walden, in a Monday conference call, noted \"It’s obviously a tough one for us. We loved 'American Idol.'  It's so connected to the Fox brand.\"\"I would say it was a bit of a complicated process over the past year to figure out whether we were interested or not,\" Walden continued. \"We sat down with ['Idol' producer] Fremantle just a month or two after the end of the show. They were determined to get the show back on the air as quickly as possible. We felt very strongly — the ratings bounced back a little bit in the final season. We spent about $25 million sending a clear and persistent message that it was the farewell season, and fans responded and the ratings ticked up. It felt to us, sitting in those initial meetings with Fremantle, like it would be extremely fraudulent to bring the show back quickly, that our fans would not appreciate being told one thing and then have the show brought back right away.\"With those differing opinion and the ratings over the four years prior to the final season dropping almost 70%, Walden says Fox asked for trims. Fremantle did not want to make significant cuts or test out a new judging panel and, she says, Fox respected that and decided to dub last season the \"farewell season.\"Walden says Fox was eyeing 2020 as a more reasonable return date in order to give the creators and producers a chance to tinker with the show, but Fremantle was not interested in waiting. \"They wanted it back on the air and they thought ABC was a good opportunity.\"","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:53:45.734Z","datePublished":"2017-05-15T02:55:00.000Z","headline":"Fox bosses talk ‘American Idol’ move to ABC: ‘It’s a tough one for us’","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2f79b8b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2F35%2Fe082fc3100761d65a1eecf206b84%2Fla-1494355940-5snu90t6gd-snap-image","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Yvonne Villarreal"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#fox-bosses-talk-american-idol-move-to-abc-its-a-tough-one-for-us"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Image\"The Crown,\" Netflix's epic true-life drama of the British aristocracy, was poised to be the top winner Sunday night at the BAFTA TV awards.

fans are getting the latest taste of unreleased music from the late musician’s vault with the release of a two-song medley, “Our Destiny/Roadhouse Garden.”The songs, released Friday by NPG Records/Warner Bros., will be featured on the upcoming deluxe issue of “Purple Rain,” the beloved 1984 album that’s heralded as his greatest work. “Our Destiny/Roadhouse Garden” was recorded live at Minneapolis’ First Avenue (the nightclub featured in the film) during a show on June 7, 1984 — Prince’s 26th birthday. The tender ”Our Destiny\" features vocals from Lisa Coleman of  the Revolution before Prince takes over on the exuberant “Roadhouse Garden,” where he’s joined on the chorus by Coleman and Matt “Dr.” Fink.Prince’s “Purple Rain” reissue will come in two forms: “Deluxe” and “Deluxe — Expanded Edition.” Set for release on June 23, the project includes six tracks that have “never been released or distributed in the collector or bootleg community,” according to the label.The previously unheard works include a 1983 solo version of “Possessed,” a studio version of “Electric Intercourse,” which was not known to exist until it was unearthed at the musician’s Paisley Park estate (it was the first track released to tease the reissue), a full version of “Father’s Song,” a finished master of “Katrina’s Paper Dolls” and a 10-minute take on “We Can… .”In the deluxe packaging, fans will get the 2015 Paisley Park remaster of the original “Purple Rain” tapes along with a “From the Vault & Unreleased” disc, while the expanded version will include the aforementioned, along with a third disc, “Single Edits & B-Sides,” and a concert DVD from Prince and the Revolution’s March 1985 gig at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, N.Y.“Our Destiny/Roadhouse Garden” and “Electric

But I never thought one of those things would be show business. Don’t you know I’ve been trying for a year to get you to say my name? And you were very restrained. Admirably restrained.

Hence, the memo.The missive seemed like a reasonable request on many levels, since in it Harvey explained that he was \"seeking more free time\" for himself during the day and asked that people not \"take offense to the new way of doing business.\" Problem was, it also included a litany of all-caps laden, don't-you-dare directives, plus a threat that anyone standing at the dressing room door hoping to speak to Harvey would be removed by security. “[I]n hindsight,” he told “ET,” “I probably should've handled it a little bit differently.”Here’s a taste of how he did handle it:\"Do not open my dressing room door.

Most prominently, he teamed with R.E.M.’s Mike Mills and Peter Buck and others to form the Baseball Project, which  performs songs only about America’s pastime.In 2012, a reformed Dream Syndicate toured to celebrate three decades of “The Days of Wine and Roses,” and the group has continued to perform road gigs. In the fall, the band will embark on a European tour. Joining Duck will be longtime Dream Syndicate bassist (and Miracle 3 member) Mark Walton and guitarist Jason Victor.The forthcoming Anti- album doesn’t have an official release date or a title, but Wynn has written a statement on the Dream Syndicate’s website that says it’ll come out in September. It reads, in part: “What can we tell you about our new record?“”Well, let’s see. It’s true to our history, a bounty of gifts for everyone who’s been there since the old days and yet unlike anything we ever did before. It’s a post-millennial existential screed that feels like RIGHT NOW and at the same time a timeless joyous thrill ride. It’s psychedelic, it’s rocking, it’s garage, it’s classic, it’s indie and it’s even a soul and jazz record in the most literal sense, a sonic and emotional journey to the deepest recesses of your mind. It’s what we do on stage and yet it’s brand new. Most of all, we dig it. A lot.”Until it arrives, here is the reformed band performing the song “The Days of Wine and Roses” in 2014.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:50:05.757Z","datePublished":"2017-05-11T17:22:00.000Z","headline":"L.A. rock band the Dream Syndicate will release its first album in nearly 30 years","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/00a24d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1536x864+0+592/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4d%2F2c%2F2081104a8427412d955b597b09c0%2Fla-et-ms-dream-syndicate-20170511","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Randall Roberts"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#l-a-rock-band-the-dream-syndicate-will-release-its-first-album-in-nearly-30-years"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Image\"American Idol\" is coming back, and heralding its return are a bunch of rumors about who's going to host and who's going to judge. Most of the talk has been about the hosting gig: Ryan Seacrest is reportedly being considered to reprise his classic \"Idol\" role as ABC reboots the Fox show, with one outlet saying Seacrest's return to the show has been the plan for a while now.Another familiar face popping up for the revival is Kelly Clarkson, Fox's first \"American Idol\" winner. She's interested in a seat at the judges' table and ABC is expressing \"serious interest,\" according to TMZ. Supposedly Clarkson is \"clearing her schedule\" for the months the show would be in production. \"She was so remarkable and sincere and lovely when she came on at the last season,\" Seacrest told \"Entertainment Tonight\" on Wednesday in response to the rumors. \"I think she'd make a fantastic judge.\"So yeah, back to Seacrest. Whether that's nearly a done deal or just something some folks are chatting about is up for debate, according to Variety. A source described as close to Seacrest said the latter, allowing that \"Ryan has a lot of affection for ‘American Idol’ given the show’s significance to his career\" but labeling talks as being only \"in the early stages.\"However, another source, described as an \"insider,\" told Variety the situation was down to the \"final tweaks,\" and TMZ said days ago that the deal between Seacrest and ABC was all the way to \"closed.\"During \"Live With Kelly and Ryan\" on Monday — the day before the \"Idol\" reboot news was officially announced on \"Good Morning America\" — Seacrest told Kelly Ripa that he'd heard rumors about the show coming back only the week before and played dumb about returning to his former contestant-wrangling duties.\"I said at the end of the series, 'Goodbye for now,' hoping somewhere it would come back,\" he told Ripa, who enthusiastically encouraged him to re-up as host. She even told him she'd cover for him on \"Live\" so he could \"disconnect\" when he had to do \"AI,\" which is a pretty nice favor to do for someone who's been your cohost for less than two weeks.But there might be a reason for Ripa's unbridled enthusiasm. On Wednesday, a Page Six source painted Seacrest's gee-I-don't-know act as a cover for what's really going on.“This isn’t some spur-of-the-moment deal,\" an \"insider\" told the New York Post's gossip column. \"It’s a part of his move to ABC.\"\"It’s a no-brainer,\" the source continued. \"He took the job for ‘Idol’ and to host ‘Live.’ It’s the only way ABC could pay him enough money to come over.\"Seacrest's trademark phrase, by the way, is pinned at the top of the official \"American Idol\" Twitter page.

Amazing film that theatre chains want to block us from entering into Cannes film festival competition.”Indeed, despite the pushback from Cannes and elsewhere, Netflix has shown no interest in altering its distribution model, which involves either releasing films concurrently via streaming and in theaters or solely via streaming.In an interview with The Times last year, Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos touted the company's streaming-centered approach as a boon to many filmmakers whose movies might otherwise struggle to reach a wide audience in theaters alone.\"I think movies are special because of how well they’re crafted, how well they’re acted and shot – not because of the room that you saw them in first,\" he said, adding, \"I don’t believe it’s sensible to hold back 81 million people from watching a movie so that a couple of hundred people can see it in a theater.\"","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:54:01.840Z","datePublished":"2017-05-10T19:29:00.000Z","headline":"Cannes Film Festival and Netflix square off over the inclusion of streaming releases","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d9c267c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/600x338+0+29/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F28%2F88%2Febfda0c0f44946055aebd2207173%2F6a00d8341c630a53ef0163002d1390970d-600wi","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Josh Rottenberg"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#cannes-film-festival-and-netflix-square-off-over-the-inclusion-of-streaming-releases"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageMarvel's next big superhero team-up is with Donald Glover.

FacebookThe long-awaited third film has a working title of \"Hellboy: Rise of the Blood Queen,\" according to the Hollywood Reporter, which said that Millennium Films is in negotiations with producers Larry Gordon and Lloyd Levin for the relaunch of property written by Andrew Cosby, Christopher Golden and Mignola. Mike Richardson of Dark Horse Entertainment is also producing.The latest installment comes in the wake of Del Toro's middling two-film franchise starring \"Sons of Anarchy's\" Perlman.

Then he charged back into the fraught topic.\"I made an emotional speech that was seen by millions, and as a result of my powerful words on that night, Republicans in Congress had second thoughts about repeal and replace\" of the Affordable Care Act, he joked. \"I saved health insurance in the United States of America!\"\"What's that? I didn't save it? They voted against it anyway?\" Kimmel said. The House approved the American Health Care Act last week.He dismissed those who labeled him an elitist — as a youngster, his family bought powdered milk because they couldn't afford fresh, he said — and pretended to repent for his previous comments.\"I'd like to apologize for saying that children in America should have healthcare. It was insensitive, it was offensive, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me,\" Kimmel said.He took on former U.S. Rep. Newt Gingrich, saying his claim that all children would receive the same surgery as Kimmel's son in an emergency fell short of addressing what follows.\"That's terrific if your baby's health problems are all solved during that one visit. The only problem is that never, ever happens. We've had a dozen doctor's appointments since our son had surgery,\" Kimmel said.Kimmel brought on a current GOP lawmaker, U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician, who had suggested that the Senate's upcoming healthcare legislation should have a \"Jimmy Kimmel test\" of covering preexisting conditions but in a fiscally conservative way.During a satellite interview with Cassidy, Kimmel asked about his position on issues including uninsured workers and protection of children under a revised healthcare bill.The senator called on viewers to contact their representatives and urge support of final legislation that fulfills President Trump's promise to lower premiums combined with coverage that passes the Kimmel standard.Kimmel called for his namesake test to guarantee that no family be denied medical care, emergency or otherwise, because they can't afford it.\"You're on the right track,\" Cassidy said, but the country has to be able to pay for it.\"Don't give a huge tax cut to millionaires like me,\" Kimmel replied.On last Monday's show, the host detailed how Billy's routine birth April 21 suddenly turned frightening when he was diagnosed with a hole in the wall separating the right and left sides of the heart and a blocked pulmonary valve, a condition known as tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia. He successfully underwent surgery, but will face more as he grows.Using his son as an example, Kimmel called for healthcare for all and for preexisting conditions to remain covered as provided by the Affordable Care Act passed under President Obama. Quote\"If your baby is going to die and it doesn't have to, it shouldn't matter how much money you make. ... Whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that, right?\" he said.The video of Kimmel's tearful monologue went viral, drawing praised by some, including Obama, and harsh criticism from others.Read MoreALSOTearful Jimmy Kimmel shares story of newborn son's heart defect and surgeryColbert, Meyers and O'Brien all talk Trump and Civil War facts on late nightNicki Minaj pays fans' tuition, school expenses in a burst of generosity on social media'13 Reasons Why' is getting a second season.

In a landslide victory, Macron beat far-right rival Marine Le Pen, who led a pro-nationalist and anti-immigrant campaign.  ImageBanksy is no stranger to political and cultural criticism. In 2015, the artist created several murals depicting Syrian refugees.

So we rise. And together with grit and hope, we will celebrate America at its most beautiful and free.\"Here's a roundup of Messing's best zingers and stirring moments.Her bait and switch: \"We all must remember that one great show or character or news story can alter our culture permanently. I should know: I starred in one of the most iconic gay shows of all time... 'Smash.' By telling the story of two girls fighting it out to star in a Broadway musical based on the life of Marilyn Monroe, I believe that we taught the country about high camp and big scars without ever seeming preachy!\"I'm kidding, of course. 'Smash' came after 'Will & Grace.'\"\"It is time to make America gay again!\": \"What Vice President Joe Biden said was very humbling and eye opening: Entertainment and news media shape not only culture, but also decisions made in courtrooms, classrooms and, yes, even voting booths. The country needs excellence in media. Now more than ever, we have got to get to work, which is why I'm so happy that 'Will & Grace' is coming back in September. It is time to make America gay again! I mean, someone's gotta take down Mother Pence. Talk about a low-hanging fruit. I know that will make people laugh, but I hope that will make people think too, because things are getting dire.\"To paraphrase Charles Dickens. This year has sucked. Our democracy and humanity have been under attack. But unless you are an unenlightened, straight cisgender white male, you are a target, that means that makes us all targets.\"Her congressional switchboard call-a-thon:  \"There is a very bad and very orange man in our White House -- at least a few days a month. The person we shall not name came this close to signing an executive order that legally allows for discrimination against the LGBT community under the banner of religious freedom. If that makes you as angry as it makes me, then raise your voice. Call the White House. Call your representative. Call your senators. Actually, take out your phones right now and put in the number (202) 224-3121. That is the number of the congressional switchboard in Washington, D.C. ...keep that number in your phone. Text it to 10 people you know and call it... every day.\"Promoting the resistance: \"We are fighting for the soul of our country. But don't get discouraged. The resistance has accomplished more in the first 100 days than the president has in his. And we got pussyhats out of it, so there. Make no mistake: When we make noise, they pay attention.\"Her direct appeal to Ivanka Trump, a.k.a. \"the secretary of straight\": “It is not enough to simply say that women’s issues are important to you. It’s time to do something. Ivanka, you can change the lives of millions of women and children just by telling your dad stories about real people who are suffering. Don’t let him separate immigrant mothers from their American-born children. Don’t let him take healthcare away from women who need it. Don’t allow him to make trans kids like Gavin [Grimm] fight in court for their basic human dignity. Please stop blindly defending your father and start defending what you say you believe in. You can't just write #womenwhowork and think you're advancing feminism. You need to be a woman who does good work #saywhatyoumeanandmeanwhatyousay.\"\"Do right by your colorist\": Still directly addressing Ivanka Trump as \"one Jewish mother to another,\" she said, \"Ivanka, we know you love the guy who does your hair color. It's good, by the way. So do right by your colorist.... Imagine how you'll feel sitting at Passover Seder if you can tell your children that you fought for justice and freedom.

Pai is a former lawyer for Verizon who has vowed to \"take a weed whacker\" to regulations.The FCC also has made it harder to submit comments through a rather convoluted process on its website, so Oliver directed viewers to a website, www.gofccyourself.com, that skipped to the final step.Noting that the Internet is full of evidence (e.g., Yelp reviews of the Grand Canyon) that we all have too much time on our hands, Oliver urged his fans to join him in \"five to 10 minutes of minor effort\" to help save net neutrality. \"I need you to do this,\" he said.You can watch the full segment here.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:58:51.943Z","datePublished":"2017-05-08T16:43:00.000Z","headline":"John Oliver returns to one of his favorite causes: Saving net neutrality","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7418d05/2147483647/strip/true/crop/700x394+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2F10%2F0d11138f3f53b0870f5d9f4db924%2F700x394","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Meredith Blake"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#john-oliver-returns-to-one-of-his-favorite-causes-saving-net-neutrality"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Los Angeles may have brought the rain, but the MTV Movie & TV Awards brought the movies Sunday night, with new looks at several upcoming summer blockbusters.With \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" bringing in an estimated $145 million at the box office this weekend, summer movie season is officially here.

Everybody has great energy,\" he said. \"It doesn't feel stuffy.\"\"Get Out,\" which tackles racism head on, is also nominated for a new category at the MTV show: best fight against the system. How does Howery fight the system?

We told the truth and we were just being honest.\"Speaking of truth, among the sea of movie and TV stars stood an unexpected presence on the red carpet, Rep. Maxine Waters.

No critics. No academies. No guilds.In the show’s 26th year, such an approach persists as the network’s audience continues to drive the many changes in the show when it airs live Sunday on the East Coast from L.A.’s Shrine Auditorium at 5 p.m. (PT) and on tape delay for the West Coast at 8 p.m. (PT).Some of those changes include adding TV to the fold, hence the new name, MTV Movie & TV Awards, and getting rid of separate categories for male and female performances, de-gendering its acting categories. And it’s adding an element of politics to the show by changing its best fight category to best fight against the system.“We’re taking a fresh look at everything we're doing across the brand — the shows, events and the tent-poles — and want to lead culture,” MTV President Chris McCarthy said. “Part of that is acknowledging that this event was always about celebrating great content and stories and characters that our audience loves. With changing platforms and consumer habits, a lot of that content and those characters aren’t just in film anymore.”Read More","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:00:04.382Z","datePublished":"2017-05-07T21:57:00.000Z","headline":"Here’s what to expect from the MTV Movie & TV Awards","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/293b240/2147483647/strip/true/crop/750x422+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa7%2Fb1%2F34c330b1851755aee29658e338cb%2F750x422","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Tre’vell Anderson"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#heres-what-to-expect-from-the-mtv-movie-tv-awards"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"Image\"Hidden Figures.\" \"The Quad.\" \"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.\" These three big-budget Hollywood productions all have one thing in common: They were filmed in the Atlanta University Center, a consortium of historically black colleges and universities in the Georgia city.

Netflix's teen drama \"13 Reasons Why\" has been picked up for a second season. The show chronicles the aftermath of the suicide of 17-year-old Hannah Baker, played by Katherine Langford, and examines issues of slut-shaming, rape and social media harassment in the process. Hannah leaves behind a series of audiotapes to be listened to by the people she holds responsible for her death — including her rapist, her estranged friends and those who bullied her.  TweetGiven the nature of Hannah’s story, the show has been heavily hyped and has generated plenty of think pieces and headlines since its March 31 release:“Does ‘13 Reasons Why’ Glamorize Teen Suicide?”“Critics say ‘13 Reasons Why’ has artistic merit. Suicide prevention experts say it’s dangerous.”“ ‘13 Reasons Why’ Is Not the Force for Mental Health Awareness People Say It Is”The concerns prompted Netflix to strengthen its advisory warnings. The series has a TV-MA rating.As for what to expect in Season 2, series creator Brian Yorkey told The Times, prior to Sunday’s announcement, that “Hannah’s story isn’t over — she has parents who still don’t have the complete story.”“There’s a rapist who hasn't been brought to justice, and there’s a living survivor of that rapist who is just beginning her journey of recovery,” he said.“Part of the problem with our culture is that we say, ‘Oh, the story’s done. Rapes are treated, at best, as a multi-episode arc within a season, when anyone who’s experienced rape knows it’s a lifelong story,” Yorkey added. “If we left these 13 episodes out in the world with [the rapist] not being brought to justice … it’d be incredibly dissatisfying to me.”Season 2 will debut on Netflix next year.ALSOThe stars and creator of '13 Reasons Why' talk about the show's success and the backlashFrom 'The Handmaid's Tale' to 'I Love Dick,' the female gaze is thriving on televisionReview: '13 Reasons Why' is Netflix's newest must-see series","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:48:05.976Z","datePublished":"2017-05-07T19:32:00.000Z","headline":"‘13 Reasons Why’ is getting a second season.

She was then diagnosed with a second, more severe type of breast cancer that required a longer leave, the complaint says.According to the lawsuit, the company \"questioned the validity of her diagnosis, prevented members of her team from contacting her and deliberately damaged her reputation.\" Further, a senior executive at BET even suggested to Mashariki's colleagues that she was \"faking\" her breast cancer, the suit alleges. Mashariki also alleges in the suit that she was \"denied equal employment opportunities, including pay, development, and promotion, compared to similarly situated male employees,\" with Hill specifically called out.Hill announced March 29 that he was leaving BET; simultaneously, Mashariki's departure was \"falsely announced,\" according to the complaint. Mashariki was terminated April 11. “These claims misrepresent the facts and are without merit,\" a spokesman for BET parent Viacom said Thursday. \"We strongly deny any allegation of wrongdoing and we intend to respond to the specific allegations in the course of legal proceedings.\"At Viacom and BET, we take the health and well-being of our employees very seriously and we are committed to fostering an inclusive, diverse workplace that supports the success of all employees.\"Hill could not be immediately reached for comment.Mashariki is asking for damages that include back pay, lost benefits, and other compensation to be determined at a jury trial.Mashariki, a Dartmouth College, Harvard Law School and USC graduate, previously worked at Fox Searchlight Pictures, where over 15 years she executive produced films such as \"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,\" and \"The Secret Life of Bees.\" According to the complaint, she left the company for BET because, \"as a woman of color, BET's brand spoke to her.\"UPDATES2:17 p.m.: This article was updated to include a response from Viacom, parent company of BET. ","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:55:18.594Z","datePublished":"2017-05-04T19:57:00.000Z","headline":"Former BET executive Zola Mashariki sues, alleging gender discrimination and defamation","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bf07be9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F99%2Fee%2F5f8673c75f7109083190a5eb3d39%2Fla-et-mg-zola-maharishi-and-stephen-hill-20170504","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Sonaiya Kelley"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#former-bet-executive-zola-mashariki-sues-alleging-gender-discrimination-and-defamation"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageIt appears Miley Cyrus can be tamed after all: Pop music's enfant terrible has turned over yet another leaf, sobering up and quitting weed.“I used to [resist changing].

I’m not doing drugs, I’m not drinking, I’m completely clean right now. That was just something that I wanted to do,” she told Billboard magazine. “I like to surround myself with people that make me want to get better, more evolved, open. And I was noticing, it’s not the people that are stoned. I want to be super clear and sharp because I know exactly where I want to be.”A shockingly demure Cyrus — demure except for all the F-bombs — spoke to the magazine ahead of the May 11 release of her new single, “Malibu,” which she wrote about her reunion with beau Liam Hemsworth.

They’re currently living in “The Hunger Games” actor’s Malibu compound with seven dogs, two pigs and two miniature horses.The “breezy love song” is “gimmick-free pop-rock,” according to Billboard and is another shift for the ever-changing former Disney Channel star, who is now moving out of her 2015 “Dead Petz” phase.Her new incarnation includes reflection on how the Trump presidency has affected her personally and how she’s using it to reach out to his supporters.The Tennessee-born singer said that serving as a coach on NBC’s “The Voice” — country star Blake Shelton is also a fixture — prompted her move beyond her circle of “outspoken liberals” to try to influence country fans and red-state residents. “I’m down for hanging with Blake.

As for sitting down with Vanity Fair in such a public fashion to announce their engagement, the couple attributes the choice to the six children they have between them.\"We know that our kids have a lot of options about what they read about us. We wanted to do one interview on the record. To answer the question is just as important for them as it is for us, to say it once that we’re together and we want to be together forever,\" the pair expressed.The wedding date remains unknown. However, they’ve already ruled out one offer from a high-profile frenemy. During a January visit to the White House, Scarborough and Brzezinski had dinner with President Trump, Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. In the midst of the meal, the president told the couple that if they decided to get married, they should do so at Mar-a-Lago or the White House. He even offered to officiate.Given the tenuous relationship Brzezinski has with Trump, it’s hardly surprising that they passed on the offer.

Am I still the host? I'm still the host! \"Now, folks, if you saw my monologue on Monday, you know that I was a little upset with Donald Trump for insulting a friend of mine,\" Colbert began. \"So, at the end of that monologue I had a few choice insults for the president in return.\"On Monday, Colbert had commented an interview between John Dickerson of CBS' \"Face the Nation\" and Trump, during which the latter referred to the network's long-running show as \"Deface the Nation.\" The late-night host then explained that Dickerson had too much dignity to trade insults with the president, so he offered a string of his own.“Mr. President, I love your presidency,” Colbert said. “I call it ‘Disgrace the Nation.’ You’re not the POTUS; You’re the gloat-us. You’re the glutton with the button. You’re a regular Gorge Washington. You're the presi-dunce,\" Colbert said, then topped off his roast with a vulgar reference to oral sex between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Voices on social media, the bulk of them conservative, seized upon the remarks, labeling the last part  homophobic and calling for repercussions under the hashtag #FireColbert. Some made parallels to comments made by Bill O'Reilly, who lost his longtime show on Fox News last month in the wake of multiple allegations of sexual harassment.\"I don't regret that,\" Colbert said Wednesday, grinning like the Cheshire cat as his studio audience cheered.\"I believe he [Trump] can take care of himself,\" he added. \"I have jokes, he has the launch codes. So, a fair fight.\"He went on to explain that if he had it to do again he would change a few words that were \"cruder than they needed to be.\"“I’m not going to repeat the phrase,\" he began. \"But I just want to say, for the record, life is short, and anyone who expresses their love for another person in their own way, is to me an American hero. I think we can all agree on that. I hope even the president and I can agree on that. Nothing else, but that.\"Colbert then went on to talk about Wednesday's testimony from FBI Director James Comey.

(William and Catherine are not expected to appear at the trial.)According to the Associated Press, a French lawyer for the duke and duchess read a statement from William in court Tuesday, decrying the alleged invasion of privacy and invoking the 1997 death of William's mom. The photographs “reminded us of the harassment that led to the death of my mother, Diana Princess of Wales,\" the statement said.\"My wife and I thought that we could go to France for a few days in a secluded villa owned by a member of my family, and thus enjoy our privacy,\" it continued. \"We know France and the French and we know that they are, in principle, respectful of private life, including that of their guests. The clandestine way in which these photographs were taken was particularly shocking to us as it breached our privacy.\"The images of Catherine were taken with a telephoto lens while she was sunbathing on a private patio. Prosecutors are asking for the defendants to pay substantial fines, and the royals' lawyer said he was seeking high damages — 1.5 million euros, or about $1.6 million, according to several reports.However, defense attorneys argued that the photos came only a year after the fanfare of the globally watched royal wedding and, as the images cast the couple in a positive light,  didn't breach their privacy, ABC News reported. The photographers' defense lawyer also claimed that his clients were being uses as scapegoats in a botched investigation.A verdict is expected July 4.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:00:23.607Z","datePublished":"2017-05-03T21:18:00.000Z","headline":"Trial over topless photos of Duchess Catherine is on in

battling their own individual demons in the various boroughs of New York, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist are finally ready to become the superhero team they were always meant to be. At least sort of. The first trailer for \"Marvel's the Defenders\" has been released, giving fans their fist look at the four street-level superheroes fighting together.Of course, before they can officially join forces, the leads from Netflix's four previous Marvel shows have to meet one another.The trailer opens with Jones (Krysten Ritter) being questioned by Misty Knight (Simone Missick), the Detective first introduced in \"Marvel's Luke Cage,\" for interfering with her investigation. Before Jones can incriminate herself in any way, in steps Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) claiming to be her attorney. In another part of town, Cage (Mike Colter) is having a heart to heart with Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson), who suggests the Harlem hero might benefit from meeting another one of her friends. But it looks like before any official introductions can be made, Cage runs into Danny Rand (Finn Jones) in a dark alley under less than ideal circumstances.In addition to spotlighting these initial meetings, the trailer warns that a war for New York is brewing. The only way to save the city is for \"the devil of Hell's Kitchen, the smart-ass detective, the righteous ex-con and the kid with a glowing fist\" to work together. While Rand seems to believe the four heroes make quite a team, Jones is less than enthusiastic. But that might be because the enlightened Iron Fist can't figure out a way to describe the superpowered investigator other than \"whatever it is you are.\" Maybe Iron Fist doesn't deserve a seat at the big-heroes table.The trailer also gives a glimpse at the reanimated Elektra (Élodie Yung) back in action and Sigourney Weaver's mysterious villain Alexandra. \"Marvel's the Defenders\" will hit Netflix on Aug. 18. Watch the full trailer, which includes a bit of adult language, below.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:00:51.475Z","datePublished":"2017-05-03T16:26:00.000Z","headline":"First trailer for ‘The Defenders’ shows the birth of Marvel’s newest superhero team","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8eff489/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1000x563+0+52/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F55%2F25%2Fbc5e30e745af51d98e9fd711d6da%2F1000","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Tracy Brown"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#first-trailer-for-the-defenders-shows-the-birth-of-marvels-newest-superhero-team"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"A bunch of late-night hosts welcomed Hillary Clinton back to the news cycle, Tuesday night, swarming on her interview at a women's conference  the way a flurry of hosts had swarmed on Trump's weekend Civil War comments in their monologues the night before. \"Guess who's back?\" said Stephen Colbert during his \"The Late Show\" monologue on CBS. \"Hillary Clinton. She emerged from the woods just this afternoon.\"Actually, the former secretary of State spoke with CNN's Christiane Amanpour before an audience at the Women to Women International conference in New York on Monday, but it took till Tuesday to show up on late-night TV (breaking news travels slowly to late night, which tapes in the afternoon).Among the questions Amanpour asked Clinton was whether she thought that misogyny existed in the United States. (It was a question that got laughs of its own, and a comical \"Hmmm\" from Clinton.) Colbert's take: \"Asking Hillary Clinton if sexism exists is like asking Serena Williams if she's heard of this tennis thing. She's aware of the situation.\"\"Hillary may have accidentally revealed why she really lost,\" Colbert revealed, taking off from the former presidential candidate's misstatement to Amanpour that the election took place Oct. 28.\"No, it was on Nov. 8, ma'am,\" he said. \"That explains everything: 'Well, October 29th is here, and I am not president. Well, I guess I can stop campaigning in Michigan and Wisconsin. Goodbye!'\"That's my impression of Hillary, by the way,\" Colbert added. \"I would have worked on it more if I knew she was going to be back.\"\"Late Night\" host Seth Meyers hit similar geographical points in his opening monologue on NBC: \"Hillary Clinton said today she is very aware of the shortfalls of her campaign that caused her to lose the election, specifically Short Falls, Michigan, and Short Falls, Wisconsin.\"On Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show,\" in a segment titled \"Vent of a Woman,\" host Trevor Noah also used the \"came out of the woods\" figure of speech and went further: \"You can tell Hillary Clinton spent some time deep in that forest, because she clearly found some shade.\"Clips of Clinton saying, \"Because you know healthcare is complicated\" and \"I did win 3 million votes more than my opponent\" followed.\"After 100 days, it was refreshing to hear a politician talk in full sentences,\" Noah said of the Clinton interview. \"No 'tremendouses,' no hand gestures, not one description of chocolate cake. I didn't realize how much I missed hearing sentences with a beginning, middle and end.\"Still, he continued, \"We've all been inundated by cable news' fake excitement and sound bitingness for so long that I don't think Hillary Clinton or a candidate like her could ever connect with people.

Billy was taken to Children's Hospital of L.A. by ambulance, and on April 24 underwent a three-hour surgery to repair a hole in his heart. It was successful. Six days later they brought Billy home, and dad says the kid's doing great, though he'll face another surgery when he's older. Kimmel showed off before-and-after pictures of the baby, one with lots of tubes and gear and the other with simply a big, goofy smile.  \"Poor kid, not only did he get a bad heart, he got my face,\" said Kimmel, who'd taken a week-plus off work because of his family emergency. Kimmel had abundant thanks for the medical professionals, friends, co-workers and family who'd offered support. \"We had atheists praying for us,\" he said, and even sworn enemy Matt Damon sent flowers. In closing his 13-minute opening monologue, he made an emotional, passionate plea to politicians who would be considering healthcare legislation and health funding in general. \"No parent should ever have to decide whether they can afford to save their child's life,\" Kimmel said, fighting back tears as he talked about other families he saw at Children's Hospital. \"It just shouldn't happen.

It highlights a number of the social media posts that went viral on Thursday and Friday about the situation in the Bahamas. The music and lifestyle festival, billed as \"the cultural experience of the decade,\" melted down spectacularly as thousands of guests who'd paid thousands of dollars to enjoy the weekend arrived on a private island to find that preparations were nowhere close to finished. Organizers canceled the planned two-weekend event on Friday, but not before people who'd flown out found themselves stranded.The complaint, filed by high-profile attorney Mark Geragos on behalf of named plaintiff Daniel Jung of Los Angeles, painted a dramatic picture: \"The festival’s lack of adequate food, water, shelter and medical care created a dangerous and panicked situation among attendees.\" The event was to have been \"cashless,\" which complicated would festival-goers' efforts to get home after the cancellation, the suit alleges. \"Defendants instructed attendees to upload funds to a wristband for use at the festival rather than bringing any cash. As such, attendees were unable to purchase basic transportation on local taxis or buses, which accept only cash.\"Fyre Media Inc. did not respond immediately Monday to a request for comment. However, organizers had offered an explanation about the festival itself in a statement issued Friday.\"As amazing as the islands are, the infrastructure for a festival of this magnitude needed to be built from the ground up. So, we decided to literally attempt to build a city. We set up water and waste management, brought an ambulance from New York, and chartered 737 planes to shuttle our guests via 12 flights a day from Miami. We thought we were ready, but then everyone arrived,\" it said, in part. \"The team was overwhelmed. The airport was jam-packed. The buses couldn’t handle the load. And the wind from rough weather took down half of the tents on the morning our guests were scheduled to arrive. This is an unacceptable guest experience and the Fyre team takes full responsibility for the issues that occurred,\" the statement continued.Refunds would be issued and all would-be guests would receive VIP passes to the festival next year, organizers said.  TweetAn apologetic Ja Rule — who said Friday that he was taking \"responsibility\" for a mess that was \"NOT MY FAULT\" —tweeted Sunday that he was pleased to hear that all festival guests were safe and had been sent refund application forms. Bella Hadid, who had helped promote the festival, tweeted Saturday that she felt \"sorry and badly\" that she \"couldn't stand by\" the event. \"Even though this was not my project what so ever, nor was I informed about the production or process of the festival in any shape or form, I do know that it has always been out of great intent and they truly wanted all of us to have the time of our lives.\" TweetThis post will be updated.","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:54:13.650Z","datePublished":"2017-05-01T19:10:00.000Z","headline":"Fyre Festival organizers hit with $100-million class-action lawsuit","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Christie D’Zurilla"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-2017-htmlstory.html#fyre-festival-organizers-hit-with-100-million-class-action-lawsuit"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageActor Eric Dane is battling depression, and he's taking time off to manage it.\"The Last Ship\" star, best known as Dr. Mark \"McSteamy\" Sloan from \"Grey's Anatomy,\" is taking a break from his TNT naval drama to deal with \"personal issues.\"“Eric asked for a break to deal with personal issues,” his representative said in a statement to The Times. \"He suffers from depression and has asked for a few weeks of downtime and the producers kindly granted that request.\"Production has been shut down temporarily, and Dane, 44, \"looks forward to returning\" to work, the representative said.The series, based on William Brinkley's post-apocalyptic novel of the same name, recently aired its third season and has been renewed for 10-episode fourth and fifth seasons.
