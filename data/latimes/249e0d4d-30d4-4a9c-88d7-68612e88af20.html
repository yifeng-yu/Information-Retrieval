A mesmerizing light show begins at dawn and dusk when the frame is illuminated with colored light, enhancing the sky’s own changing hues.The Skyspace is a part of the Pomona College Museum of Art. For Turrell, an L.A. native and alumnus of Pomona College (’65) and Claremont Graduate University (’73), this campus installation is a homecoming of sorts, and the only public Skyspace in Southern California.Turrell is an avid pilot and considers the sky his studio, material and canvas, and his Pomona College training in perceptual psychology informs his play of light, space, and human perception.Skyspace programs begin one hour before sunrise and 10 minutes before sunset.

The boathouse and pedal boat operation go back decades. And the place has been dramatically upgraded in the last few years, beginning with a draining and cleaning in 2011-2013. The paddle boats operated by Wheel Fun Rentals are now shaped like swans and the larger ones hold up to five people or 1,400 pounds. (These boats look a lot like the historic swan boats in Boston Common, which also go back to the 1870s.)Head out for an hour of pedaling and drifting, not necessarily in that order, and imagine the early 20th century days when Aimee Semple McPherson was preaching in the Angelus Temple next door and these hills were crawling with communists, socialists and spiritualists.  The boat rentals are open daily all year from 9 a.m. until sunset. On the hottest days, try edging right up to the edge of the fountain in the middle of the lake – you’ll be coated with mist or (if there’s a breeze) pelted by diagonal rain. The last rentals go out an hour before sunset. (One night in July, a young man broke in and took a paddle boat for a forbidden ride. It did not end well.)The eatery, Beacon, opened in January 2017 with a menu that’s longer, more intriguing and a little pricier than the average public park snack shack. The communists don’t live here anymore.Bonus option: Fishing is allowed, with a license.Where: 751 Echo Park Ave., 2 miles northwest of downtown L.A.How much: The swan boats rent for hourly rates of $11 per adult, $6 per minor. Everybody gets a life jacket. A sampling from the Beacon menu: kale and avocado burritos ($7), a crab and gouda sandwich ($13), salmon toast ($10), Beacon Burger ($15), lemonade ($3).

In fact, you can see bits of San Francisco Bay —  distant wharves, cargo ships, maybe a few kayaks in McCovey Cove — from many of the 41,915 seats in AT&T Park. And in a city that’s not always easy for families, this park is full of kid-friendly features.What: The Giants have been based in San Francisco since 1958, but they only started winning championships here after this ballpark opened in 2000. (Beyond center field you’ll see banners celebrating the team’s World Series victories in 2010, 2012 and 2014, and a few more from the earlier New York years.)Builders worked hard to reduce the winds that made the old Candlestick Park a nightmare for anyone fielding a fly ball —  and largely succeeded. In fact, experts often rank this park first or second among the most pleasant in the major leagues.But there’s no banishing the gulls.At the end of every game, thousands of the scavenging creatures come swooping in to feast on leavings in the bleachers.

(Admit it, you’re already uncomfortable.)That was Disney’s mission with this park. And Disney failed … at first. But since that awkward debut in 2001, when attendance fell far short of expectations, the park people have been steadily changing and fixing this place. Even if you’re skeptical about all things Disney (as some people are), you’ll probably get a kick out of this cartoon version of our state.What: Most of the park’s rides, restaurants and photo ops are all about idealizing California, including Hollywood Land (who’s ever seen such clean streets and tidy storefronts in the real Hollywood?); Pacific Wharf (a mix of Cannery Row in Monterey and Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco); and Grizzly Peak (a nod to Yosemite and the tall trees of Northern California). But other features these days reach far beyond state lines.When I dropped in a few days ago, the park’s marching bands and mariachis were joined by drummers, dancers and musicians from around Asia, gathered to celebrate Lunar New Year. Rides in A Bug’s Land and Car Land were full of grinning guests, as was the Soarin’ Around the World ride — which replaced Soaring (over California) in 2016 — and the Guardians of the Galaxy-Mission: Breakout! ride — which replaced the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror in 2017. This summer, Paradise Pier is scheduled to become Pixar Pier.Meanwhile, California Screamin’, Mickey’s Fun Wheel and Grizzly River Run were closed for refurbishment.

There’s no more dramatic passage from Central California’s blond hills to the Big Sur coast than this 24-mile route.What: Nacimiento-Fergusson Road, a winding, two-lane highway, begins in the Salinas Valley countryside north of Paso Robles, next to the often-overlooked Mission San Antonio de Padua and the Army’s Ft. Hunter-Liggett. From there it creeps through forest and chaparral to the crest of the Santa Lucia Mountains, about 2,800 feet above sea level. Then for 7 miles, via dozens of switchback turns, it wends its way down the western slopes to Big Sur.It meets Highway 1 at Kirk Creek, about 4 miles south of Lucia. Image ImageMotorcyclists have loved Nacimiento-Fergusson Road for years. When a mudslide and reconstruction closed Highway 1 at Mud Creek for more than a year in 2017-2018, many more cars found their way to this alternative, as well.In normal times, with Highway 1 open, you can usually count on thin traffic on Nacimiento-Fergusson. The road’s westernmost 7 miles, descending via multiple sharp turns to the coast road, are as spectacular as can be — and might start a three-alarm panic attack if you’re afraid of heights. (When a route is featured on www.dangerousroads.org, you know it’s special.)Given the absence of lights or guard rails or cellphone reception, I’d never try it after dark. On my midday drive in December, I took care to ignore the views until I’d safely pulled into one of the many turnouts along the way. (For a tamer ride with similar scenery, take Highway 46 west from Paso Robles to Cambria.)Where: To reach the eastern end of Nacimiento-Fergusson Road, exit Highway 101 at Jolon Road, about 23 miles north of Paso Robles. Follow Jolon Road west, then turn left onto Mission Road, continue 4 miles, then turn left onto Nacimiento-Fergusson Road. Because the road passes through the Army base, drivers may need to show license, registration and proof of insurance.Give the drive at least two hours from the 101 to the 1.

(Yes, you can go to City Hall's 27th floor observation deck and it's free). The park isn't really new -- there's been open space for decades on these blocks between government buildings. But a dramatic redesign in 2012 put a far better spin on the area, and it doesn't hurt that neighboring Cathedral of our Lady of the Angels arrived in 2002, Disney Hall in 2003 and the Broad Museum in 2015.Besides its welcome green expanses and flanking playground and dog-run areas, Grand Park includes a fountain (with splash pad for kids), an adjacent Starbucks, plenty of places to sit and a busy schedule of holiday events and live shows. Picnicking is encouraged. Protesting is permitted. Food trucks come for lunch most Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. There's midday yoga on many Wednesdays and Fridays. In October and November, the park hosts Día de los Muertos altars and art; in November and December, holiday lights.And on New Year's Eve -- well, the 2016-17 party (free and alcohol-free) included three stages, DJs, live music, dancing, inflatable art, and light projections.

It’s the cascade that other waterfalls want to be. It’s also a perfectly impossible California destination, because you can’t stand under these falls. There’s no safe way to the beach.What: The hike is more of a stroll, really. It’s about half a mile, mostly flat. (And the rest of the park remains mostly closed because of mudslides and other damage done by the Soberanes Fire of 2016.) Once you’ve passed through a short tunnel under Highway 1 and made a right turn, you’ll soon be standing on a rocky perch where a house once stood, looking south to the beach and falls.This is an invitation to chill. For one thing, the trail has ended. Also, like Yosemite Falls — which led off our California Bucket List project on Jan. 1 — McWay Falls is a sort of perpetuity made plain. The water keeps coming, even if it’s in short supply elsewhere. And the cell reception is so rotten that you’ll probably never get an Instagram photo posted from here.So have a seat.

ImageIt’s also a reminder of the man whose desire to understand Scripture caught fire when he was in his 50s. Emanuel Swedenborg was born Jesper Svedborg in 1688 in Stockholm. In “Swedenborg: An Introduction to His Life and Ideas,” author Gary Lachman describes Swedenborg as the “Scandinavian Da Vinci.”  He was a scientist, poet, writer, mystic, statesman, inventor and biblical scholar.After Swedenborg’s death in 1772 in London, societies took root that were devoted to contemplating his thoughts and works; the Bible is the center of these. These organizations made their way across the pond by the late 1780s, and the New Church (sometimes called New Jerusalem) began to spread in the United States. ImageNotable Swedenborgian churches include the Wayfarer’s Chapel in Palos Verdes, designed by Lloyd Wright, son of Frank Lloyd Wright. The younger Wright was said to have taken his architectural inspiration for the chapel, dedicated in 1951, from Northern California’s redwoods.Where: The Swedenborgian Church of San Francisco, 2107 Lyon St , is about 385 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.Cost: Free.

These are not the plastic model car kits from your childhood; for example, there's an eye-popping version of a 1932 Duesenberg SJ that has more than 6,000 custom-made parts and is said to have taken more than 10 years to finish.

On a bright SoCal morning, the colors, detail and craftsmanship come alive. And throughout December, there are some intriguing pre-parade opportunities for volunteers.What: One of L.A.’s finest freebies, the Rose Parade steps off at 8 a.m. every New Year’s morning (unless the holiday falls on a Sunday, in which case it is bumped to Monday). We won’t even bother describing it, since like the “Wizard of Oz” or a Super Bowl, everyone has probably seen it on TV. ImageIn person, though, the parade’s splendor, precision and pageantry make an early wake-up call worth it. It’s almost a rite of passage for Southern Californians, some of whom spend the night along the parade route.The parade has more rules than the Vatican.Do not pass the blue “Honor Line” painted on the street.No tents, sofas or boxes.Unoccupied chairs are not allowed.No roping off public areas.And that’s pretty much just the main stuff. Here’s a full list. But don’t let them ruin your fun. The parade, after all, is one the best family-friendly events in the area, and they’re just protecting that.To be a part of it all, join in on the float building in the days and weeks before the parade, when the flowers are being supplied and volunteer help is needed. On parade day, get there before sunup to be sure of a place along the route.Tickets in the grandstands are another option. Be sure to dress in layers, because the temperatures will range from frosty to blistering as the day progresses.Here’s a little insider’s trick that you won’t believe until you see it. If you wait till the 8 a.m. start time, the crowd will be in place on the route and there is virtually no traffic. Pay the $20 parking fee at a random gas station along Walnut and join the fun. You won’t be in the first row, or maybe even the first 10. But the floats are so high, you’ll be able to see them well.

It fills a city block. And since the early 1990s, the hotel has been putting together an ever-more-lavish Festival of Lights. At last count, about 5 million lights.What: For six weeks at Christmastime, the landmark hotel switches on all those lights and invites visitors to stroll through the property, including a tunnel where faux snow falls. (This year’s festival runs Nov. 24 through Jan. 6.) The line to walk the property can get very long — and the traffic and parking situation in the blocks around the hotel can seem downright devilish. But most folks are in a good mood, and the festival includes live music, horse-drawn carriages, funnel cakes, Santa Claus photo ops and more. To see more lights and skip the line, book a dinner reservation at the Mission Inn Restaurant (one of several on the property) and you may land at a courtyard table, surrounded by Spanish Revival architecture that’s more ornate (and with more Tuscan influence) than you’ll see at any of California’s 21 actual missions.  ImageAnd yes, there’s a reason the decorations seem to be in motion: Besides lights, the halls and walls have also been festooned with about 200 angels, gnomes, polar bears, many of which move, in the same halting, semi-spooky way that Honest Abe moves in Disneyland’s “Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln.” It’s a scene.And speaking of presidents, be sure to peek at the hotel’s Presidential Lounge and its portrait of Richard Nixon, who was a 27-year-old attorney when he married Pat Ryan at the hotel in 1940.

But, then, neither of those towns produced a man who went on to win a Pulitzer, a Nobel and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. To be in in Steinbeck’s hometown is to be reminded that, as fellow author F. Scott Fitzgerald said, “genius is the ability to put into effect what is in your mind.”What:  Steinbeck’s birthplace home and the National Steinbeck Center tell the tale of the man whose “Grapes of Wrath” is often thought to be the Great American Novel. The community of his youth — he was born here in 1902 — was this rich, rural farming area in the Salinas Valley, and his labors alongside migrant workers in the sugar beet fields of nearby Spreckels informed many of his works, including “Of Mice and Men.” Image ImageHe attended Stanford but never graduated, and he struggled to establish himself, but in 1935, his book “Tortilla Flat” finally put him in the public eye. His subsequent books included “Cannery Row,” “Sea of Cortez” and “East of Eden” and, of course, “Grapes of Wrath,” about which he wrote, “It isn’t the great book I hoped it would be.” The story of the Joads, fleeing the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma and arriving in not-quite-as-billed California, won the Pulitzer in 1940.You can have lunch at the Steinbeck House, the Queen Anne style home where he grew up, then stroll the two blocks to the National Steinbeck Center, which somehow captures and conveys the challenges of his writing life.One of the central pieces of the center is Rocinante, the 1960 GMC camper pickup he drove on a 10,000-mile road trip as he scoured the country seeking its essence. The resulting book, “Travels With Charley” (Charley was his poodle), chronicles what Steinbeck saw as a country in sometimes uncomfortable motion.The center, which turns 20 in 2018, also does not shy away from the controversy that arose from the author’s portrayal of farm workers’ lot in life in “Grapes of Wrath.” His books infuriated growers — some places banned them — and he turned his back on his hometown.But as if to prove you can go home again, Steinbeck, who died in 1968 in New York City at age 66, is buried in Salinas.Where: The Steinbeck House is at 132 Central Ave.; lunch is served 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays; reservations at (831) 757-5806.  The National Steinbeck Center is at 1 Main St., about 305 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

Brush up on your Rodgers and Hammerstein (“Bali Hai may call you / Any night, any day”), then come away to this San Diego tiki icon, the Bali Hai restaurant. What: Tiki bars have been a Southern California phenomenon for generations, and San Diego — with its sunny days, palm trees, ocean views and strong Navy heritage — is a perfect fit for the kitschy fad, tiny umbrellas and all. Starting in the 1930s, faux-Polynesian themed bars and restaurants sprang up in the cross-border region from Tijuana to San Diego. The tiki scene started to dwindle in the 1960s, and despite a resurgence of sorts, most of the old cheeky palaces have faded away.But not Bali Hai. At age 63, it’s still proudly shaking its hula skirt, aided by a waterfront location, fun ambiance and, yes, seriously powerful mai tais. ImageAmbiance first: As you approach the restaurant/bar, the first thing you’ll notice is “The Goof” on the roof, a playful tiki that stands guard over the domain below. At the front door, Mr. Bali Hai, a large wood sculpture, greets guests.Inside, there are about a hundred Polynesian artifacts on display, including masks, weapons and tools. The large bar and dining room have dark wood columns, a wood-beam ceiling and large windows with great bay and city views.The Pacific Rim-inspired menu features such items as Hawaiian tuna poke, chicken adobo steam buns, Spam carbonara, pork belly katsu and Chinese garlic noodles, and holdovers such as Huli Huli chicken and coconut shrimp.But for my money, the experience isn’t complete without a rum-based cocktail. There are plenty to choose from, but my favorite is the “World Famous Bali Hai Mai Tai,” a potent drink that proudly has “No Juice Added” and mixes aged light and dark rums, Trader Vic’s orgeat syrup, a dash of Triple Sec and a splash of sweet and sour.Where: 2230 Shelter Island Dr., on Shelter Island, about 5 miles west of downtown San Diego, 120 miles southeast of downtown L.A.How much: Dinner main dishes from $19 to $30; Sunday brunch, $40.

It’s where people spend their birthdays, anniversaries, congrats-on-your-promotion dinners and holiday parties. And where football players competing in the Rose Bowl go for the Beef Bowl. What: Walking through the heavy gold doors is like walking into a time machine. Through the other side is a magical place where people still dress up, spotless glasses sparkle on crisp white tablecloths and the plush booths make you feel like the most important person in the world.The idea was to create a version of the English restaurant Simpson’s in the Strand, where cuts of meat fit for a giant are served from trolleys. But Lawry’s founders Lawrence Frank and brother-in-law Walter Van de Kamp (of the Van de Kamp bakery empire and Tam O’Shanter Inn) had grander plans for their restaurant, starting with the meat carts. ImageLawrence designed the stainless steel carving carts the restaurant is known for — the ones that glide through the dining room carrying Flintstones-sized cuts of meat — to be, well, impressive. And they are. As are the meat carvers, who don medals showing they are part of the Royal Order of Carvers (a title that requires six months of training).Each prime rib dinner comes with its own show of sorts: Servers wear the same style of “brown gown” uniforms they wore when the restaurant opened, and they pour dressing from up high into spinning metal bowls of salad tableside. When you order your prime rib, you do it directly from one of the shiny carts, and it’s sliced to order.There are smaller cuts of meat, but treat yourself to the Diamond Jim Brady (16 ounces), named for millionaire Jim Brady, who was known for eating massive amounts of food.  All of the prime rib dinners come with the spinning salad, a scoop of mashed potatoes, a ladleful of gravy and a wedge of Yorkshire pudding. If you don’t finish it all  — you probably won’t finish it all — ask for a doggie bag. The restaurant claims to have initiated the idea, along with valet parking.There are Lawry’s the Prime Rib locations in Las Vegas, Chicago and Asia. The original in Beverly Hills is home to a comfortable lounge and excellent bar snacks. This is where you can order a martini kissed with prime rib-stuffed olives and find complimentary “snacks” that could easily replace your dinner appetizers.Arrive a little early for your reservation, grab a seat in one of the cushy lounge chairs, order a martini, then take turns filling your plate with cocktail meatballs and salty potato chips the size of drink coasters. Go for it. Indulging to your heart’s content is encouraged. Where: 100 La Cienega Blvd., Beverly Hills, located on Restaurant Row, about half a mile south of the Beverly Center, about 10 miles west of downtown L.A.How much: Prime rib dinners start at $41, and you can add a lobster tail for $15.

Then more artists and architects arrived. Then the entrepreneurs and developers. In another 20 minutes, it’ll be Soho West.What: The Arts District, a big chunk of downtown between the Los Angeles River and South Alameda Street, has actually been gaining momentum for about three decades. Now is the time to swoop in and enjoy how bright, shiny and tasty it has become. (And spare a minute to mourn the long-ago passing of Al’s Bar, once the life of the neighborhood.)On East Third Street now, you can confront edgy and expensive contemporary art; browse a bookshop or boutique; settle into a leisurely lunch at Manuela; or bring a brown bag and have a seat in the courtyard next to the kitchen garden and chicken coop. And that’s just inside the Hauser & Wirth Los Angeles gallery complex that opened in 2016. ImageNearby on Traction Avenue and neighboring streets (where’s there still ample grit), you can can check out an event at the Southern California Institute of Architecture (which was built from the bones of a 1907 Santa Fe freight depot), hoist a beer at Angel City Brewery, and get sausage at Wurstkuche, a burger at Umami, dessert at Piehole or Salt & Straw — more than two dozen options, in addition to the lofts, studios and galleries that give the neighborhood its industrial-bohemian bearing.What you can’t do is park. Every time I’ve tried, it’s been a nightmare. So now I walk. The Metro Gold Line’s Little Tokyo/Arts District station is fairly handy on Alameda between Temple and First streets.Where: In many ways, E. 3rd Avenue and Traction Avenue is the neighborhood crossroads. It’s right downtown, less than a mile south of Los Angeles City Hall.How much: A basic sausage at Wurstkuche costs  $7. A tasty plate of persimmon, ham and burrata cheese at Manuela goes for $14.

Beneath stately redwoods is a quiet repository of wisdom, irreverence and charm. Its proprietors say that it is the place “where nothing happens,” and yet it is where everything seems to converge.What: Henry Valentine Miller came to Big Sur in the 1940s after nearly a decade in Paris. He was, by then, author of “Tropic of Cancer” and “Tropic of Capricorn,” which were banned as obscene in America until 1961. Naturally they sold well, and Miller soon became a hero of renegade literature, a model for William S. Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. After Miller’s death in Pacific Palisades in 1980, a friend, Emil White, opened a memorial library that bore Miller’s name. With the help of the Big Sur Land Trust, the library has become a nonprofit cultural space, art gallery, performance space, bookshop and destination for artists, writers, musicians and students. ImageThe Henry Miller Memorial Library is a reminder of the pleasures afforded by a curated bookstore. It is a place to celebrate the macho and feminist, the consensual and the iconoclastic through the pages of its eclectic collection of books. Psychedelic cumbias from Peru or the twanging guitar of the Del Tones might be your accompaniment as you browse the tables set with Edward Abbey, Joseph Heller, William Faulkner, John Fante, David Foster Wallace, Jon Stewart, Robert Pirsig and William Least Heat Moon.Strings of paper money from around the world – offerings from international visitors – dangle from the ceiling. Posters celebrate the notable musical performances that have taken place outdoors, including Philip Glass and Patti Smith, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Arcade Fire. Outside, an upright piano falls to ruin off the path from the highway. A typewriter gathers rust on a tree stump, and an effigy made of extension cords is crucified on a cross of computer monitors.In other words, where nothing is sacred, everything is sacred.

But among these hills on the back side of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, some students have allowed their boldest notions to romp free. And horses romp with them.What: Cal Poly is routinely ranked among the nation’s top schools of architecture, and its students and professors started testing ideas in this canyon as early as the 1960s. Lately, there’s a spring Design Village event (April 20-22 in 2018) that brings students out to test temporary structures and sometimes sleep in them. Luckily for the rest of us, those nine acres and the rest of the canyon are generally open to the public, including dogs and mountain bikes (on the dirt road). It’s a hike of about 2.5 miles from campus to the farthest structure, but your mileage (and elevation gain) will depend on how tempted your are to probe the structures and stalk the horses. Image ImageI wandered around on a December day when the hills were the color of straw, and at first I wasn’t so happy about all the horse turds. But once the horses themselves showed up, that changed everything. They sidled up to a water tower, then struck heroic poses on the ridge line while I prowled around assorted unconventional houses and bridges, including a geodesic dome. Yes, there was some graffiti and vandalism, but many structures have been reconditioned in more recent years. (The university calls it an “experimental construction laboratory.”)I’d call it a great spot for photo experimentation as well. There are about 20 projects, and plenty of tree shade in the lowlands along Brizzolara Creek. After a rain, I’ll bet those grassy slopes light up neon green.Where: The Cal Poly campus is 195 miles northwest of downtown L.A. Enter the campus via Grand Avenue (and beware of dorm construction near the entrance). Follow the campus map to the corner of Village Drive and Poly Canyon Road, then walk northeast on Poly Canyon Road, which is a gate dirt rout that follows Brizzolara Creek. After about 3/4 of a mile, you’ll see a stone arch. Step through and the canyon will open before you.How much: On weekends, parking is free at lot H4 at Village Drive and Perimeter Road. On weekdays, it’s $5 for a parking pass at the checkpoint at the campus entrance.

And it sits on 4 acres in the middle of an upscale Palm Springs neighborhood.What: The Coachella Valley, with its 80-degree December days, is a quirky place to celebrate winter holidays to begin with. And the quirks multiply once you enter Palm Springs’ Movie Colony neighborhood and approach the Irwin house, about two blocks from the old Frank Sinatra Estate. Since at least 32 years ago, when he was 12, Kenny Irwin has been driven to create epic displays from cast-off items — dreamscapes that suggest robots, space aliens and more obscure spectacles that defy description. With his father’s support (and a corps of seasonal workers to handle logistics and crowd control), Irwin’s compulsion has grown into Robolights, a seasonal landmark that combines Santa Clauses, reindeer, sleighs and gingerbread houses with little green men, skulls, dolls, hybrid creatures, reclaimed consumer electronics, half-melted toys and at least one coffin. At Robolights there are no clear lines between Halloween, Christmas and science fiction. ImageFrom Nov. 22 through Jan. 8, the scene is lighted by thousands of bulbs and visitors are ushered along a path that leads from the front yard through a forest of fantasy in the back, then out again. A thousand visitors in a night is not uncommon. On my visit in early December, Irwin was out and about, a soft-spoken man with a skullcap, caftan, long beard and gentle smile. (Did I mention that the artist converted to Islam many years ago?)“I’ll bet the hardware store totally loves him,” I heard one visitor say. “This is insane,” said another.

Granvia Valmonte, Palm Springs, 107 miles east of downtown L.A.  But while the Robolights are lighted, the city bans nonresident parking on many streets nearby, so you’ll need to park a few blocks away.

No reservations required. Just drop in with $15 and a beach towel (or a yoga mat if you prefer).Instructor/owner Brad Keimach is a Juilliard-trained classical music conductor who moonlights – or sunlights – with these yoga classes every Saturday and Sunday from 10:30 till noon. He also holds Wednesday sunset classes starting at 3:45 p.m. and lasting an hour. When the days are longer and the clocks change, he adds more weekday sunset classes. ImageFor almost 10 years, his beach-based classes have appealed to first-timers as well as advanced yoga buffs. They are held on the water side of Guard Tower 29, roughly on the border between Venice and Santa Monica. Paid parking is plentiful at the public lots at the end of Ocean Park or on Main Street.Like many yoga instructors, Keimach emphasizes breathing as well as the moves and poses.  He also incorporates the setting, sending students to get their toes wet at one point for a bit of spiritual spritzing.The classes pass quickly, without pain, and without Keimach putting his hands all over the students (a too-common yoga studio experience).

Not in the middle of a grand scene like Union Square or the Ferry Building, but along a street that feels like a neighborhood just a bit beyond your means. With Victorian mansions here and there. Hello, Union Street.What: Union Street has had its great-shopping reputation since the 1950s. The eight-block stretch between Van Ness Avenue and Steiner Street, surrounded by the Marina and Cow Hollow residential neighborhoods, is the prime retail portion.Many of the shops (which tilt toward apparel and beauty products) and restaurants are housed in Victorian mansions that survived the quake of 1906. One even older mansion, the pale blue Octagon House at Gough and Union, went up in 1861 and has been preserved in its residential state by the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America (so it would be wrong to knock on the door and ask if this is the weed dispensary you’ve heard so much about). The society opens the house a few days a month for tours.Among the restaurants, I can vouch for the Belgian food and beer at Belga (on Union near Buchanon Street). But there are more than two dozen.

At the Self-Realization Fellowship Meditation Gardens in Encinitas, you can be fully present in the moment and get in touch with your inner yogi – and do it surrounded by gorgeous gardens on a bluff overlooking the ocean.What: The goal of the Meditation Gardens, part of a large complex at the southern end of downtown Encinitas dedicated to the teachings of Paramahansa Yogananda, is to “inspire you to a greater realization of the Divine Presence that lies within.” Walking up the stone steps into the lush, eclectic gardens imparts an instant feeling of serenity. ImageThere are koi ponds and many quiet nooks with benches where you can sit. At the top of the ocean bluff is a plaque that marks the location of the Golden Lotus Temple. The temple, built in 1937 to take advantage of the incredible views, only stood for five years before the ground gave way and it had to be dismantled.

It is one of the easiest L.A. sports venues to park near ($12) and navigate.Reopened in 2012 after a two-year renovation, the stadium now offers modern concessions, more room to roam and 1,000 more seats.

Wooden started it all, taking over as head basketball coach at UCLA in 1948 and leading the Bruins to a record 10 national championships.Renowned for his disciplined, values-driven approach, he created a basketball dynasty that won seven straight championships in the late ’60s and early ’70s, including 98 successive victories at Pauley.Wooden, who died in 2010, is the first person to be inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame both as a player and a coach.Though he resembled a gentleman banker more than a rock star, Wooden’s legacy lives on in the stadium he made famous.

At the flagship In-N-Out location just south of the 10 Freeway in the eastern L.A. County suburb of Baldwin Park, of course you can drive through, as most customers do. But you could eat inside, then browse a company store, then (on the north side of the freeway) admire a non-functioning replica of chain’s first burger shack.  What: Harry and Esther Snyder founded the first In-N-Out burger shack in 1948, which puts them among the first to try a drive-through restaurant. Now their granddaughter runs the company.To taste what the fuss is all about, order a “double-double, animal-style”  — two beef patties cooked with mustard, two slices of cheese and a choice of hand-leafed lettuce and tomato, plus pickles, extra spread and grilled onions.It’s the appeal of these burgers and fries (“no heat lamps, freezers or microwaves”) that has fueled the company’s growth to more than 300 outlets. (But unlike its Southern California cousins McDonald’s, Jack in the Box, Taco Bell and Wienerschnitzel, In-N-Out has never expanded beyond the American West.) ImageThough the company’s first home at San Francisquito and Garvey avenues has been leveled, the current restaurant is joined by not only a store (open 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays) but  a regional distribution center, the two-story campus of In-N-Out University and the replica shack, which went up in 2014.

And the market venue happens to be a tomato toss away from the beach, a cucumber roll from the scores of shops and restaurants along the Third Street Promenade.What: About 75 farmers set up stalls along a few blocks of Arizona Avenue, which is closed to vehicles on market mornings. If you’re coming by car, you’ll have to cope with nasty traffic and parking, even at 8:30 a.m., but once you’re afoot, life is good. In late fall, you’ll likely find dates from Mecca, apples from Cuyama, persimmons from Fallbrook, pluots from Kingsbug, oranges from Ojai, mushrooms from La Habra Heights. Consider this a reminder that for all its glitz, California remains an agricultural powerhouse. And even if you’re not going to bite into that persimmon, you’ll feel the sea breeze and hear the banjo player at Arizona and 2nd, or maybe the guitarist a block to the east. ImageThe market was born in 1981, and the stampede of kitchen professionals began soon after. Noting that close relationship between growers and chefs, Saveur magazine in 2016 labeled this “L.A.’s best farmers market.”Still, it’s good to remember that other markets operate on Santa Monica’s Main Street (Sundays) and in the city’s Virginia Avenue Park (Saturdays). If you’re farther east, or you’d like more street musicians and more nonproduce merchants, there’s the Hollywood Farmers Market on Sundays from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Ivar and Selma avenues.Where: The market happens on Wednesdays along Arizona Avenue, Santa Monica, between Ocean Avenue and 4th Street from 8:30 am to 1:30 pm. On Saturdays, a smaller version occupies Arizona Avenue between between 2nd and 4th streets from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. The corner of Arizona Avenue and 4th Street is 17 miles west of downtown L.A. -- which could take an hour to drive, depending on the hour and day.How much: In late November, organic pitted Medjool dates from Mecca were $9.50 per pound. Granny Smith apples from Cuyama were $3 a pound. Fuyu persimmons from Fallbrook were $3.50 per pound.

The Napa and Temecula vineyard areas still feature plenty of balloons (which usually launch in early morning, when winds are calmer and temperatures are lower). The Palm Springs and Santa Barbara wine country areas have some too. But balloons are a rare sight along the California coast, so I grabbed a chance to soar above northern San Diego County. Though balloon pilots strive to keep their aircraft above land, the views from on high include miles of ocean and the red tile roofs of countless Mediterranean-style mansions.Rides typically last 45 to 60 minutes (depending on which way the wind blows), pilots are permitted by the Federal Aviation Administration, and it’s traditional to celebrate afterward with a glass of Champagne. In northern San Diego, it’s often a sunset operation flown by a team that started their day with a flight in Temecula. My ride in late November, operated by Compass Balloons, featured seven passengers and a pilot. (Minimum age: 5.) We launched near the Vegetable Shop at Chino Farm, (which sells produce to some of the region’s most admired restaurants). We inflated, climbed aboard, drifted over the Morgan Run golf course, and gazed down on Fairbanks Ranch, Rancho Santa Fe, Black Mountain and Carmel Valley. As our round shadow crept across fields, hills and exclusive neighborhoods, pilot Matt Downing pointed out one of Bill Gates’ houses and another that once belonged to philanthropist Joan Kroc. We touched down smoothly about 3 1/2 miles east of where we took off.I’m glad I did it when I did. Compass Balloons owner Evan Munnelly warns that flights in this area may cease within a year because take-off and landing spaces in the area are vanishing so rapidly.Where: Though several companies, including Compass, Sky’s the Limit and California Dreamin’, mention Del Mar in promoting their balloon flights, the vessels usually take off and land farther inland. For my Compass Balloons flight, we met in an Encinitas park-and-ride lot (1969 Villa Cardiff Drive, Encinitas), then the crew drove us to the launch spot.

Or you’re looking for unexpected holiday gifts. Or you’ve been hit by a craving for deep-fried fair food and it’s not fair season. For all these reasons and more, seekers like you end up at Charlie Brown Farms near Palmdale, where all your snack/drunk food fantasies, and your dreams of owning life-size replicas of the “Blues Brothers,” collide and come true.What: What started as a fruit stand in 1929 is now a six-acre hodgepodge of stores, a restaurant and a snack shop. The main building is a hokey cabin with advertisements for the various tchotchkes and snacks inside. From the road, it’s impossible to miss with signs that scream “collectibles,” “funnel cake,” “smoothies,” “jerky,” “Dole whip.” And just off the side of the building, an enclosed area with dinosaur statues. You may get whiplash trying to take it all in. ImageOnce through the front door you experience sensory overload. Directly in front of you is a rack of jerky (the store boasts more than 60 kinds, including elk and ostrich).To the right is a counter where you can order milkshakes, fried candy bars, Texas-style barbecue, funnel cakes, ice cream and a host of other foods any decent doctor would advise you stay away from. To the left, packaged nuts, candy, a room where you can fill your own honey jar, a room devoted to pickles, a room devoted to soda, a fudge counter, and all that food is mixed in with things like raccoon figurines and coffee mugs. This is also where you can find raw frog legs for that stew recipe you’ve been dying to try. And alligator meat too. But past the fudge counter is where things really start to get weird. There are rooms completely lined with dolls from all over the world. A little creepy, but if you’re in need of a doll (seriously, any doll), this is the place to find it. The life-size “Blues Brothers” statues I mentioned earlier? They’re on the way to the doll rooms. Out back is a patio with tables and chairs, where you can break open that package of elk jerky or come down from that sugar rush of deep-fried Oreos. You could wander around this place for hours and not see everything. But it’s sure fun to try. Where: 8317 Pearblossom Highway, Littlerock, a 17-minute drive from downtown Palmdale and about 65 miles northeast of downtown L.A.How much: Depends on what you’re in the mood for. Barbecue plates start around $11.50, the deep fried Oreos and Snickers are around $4 for each order, the jerky is around $8 a bag depending on the size, and the knick-knacks will range in price.

The Roosevelt elk are the largest, and for years, a bunch of them have been hanging around in the meadow next to the old schoolhouse at the Elk Country RV Resort in Trinidad, which is in Humboldt County.What: Millions of Roosevelt elk once roamed the Pacific Northwest. By 1907, fewer than 100,000 were left. Now the numbers are bigger. The lucky dozens who hang out near the RV resort seem to have a very good life. The resort, just off Highway 101, amounts to about 200 acres — tall trees, little lake, frequent fog, campsites for RVs and tents, a scenic red barn to go with the scenic red schoolhouse. Half a mile to the north is Stone Lagoon, part of Humboldt Lagoons State Park. Because temperatures along the coast are relatively mild, the elk don’t bother to migrate.But when you show up to admire them, don’t get too close. Experts calls them “wild and unpredictable animals” for a reason: Sometimes they charge. In February and March, the males typically shed their antlers. In May and June, calves are born. From late August through mid-October comes rutting season, when wildness and unpredictability reaches a peak. And the males can weigh more than 1,000 pounds.Elk sightings are also common in nearby Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. Where: 216 Idlewood Lane, Trinidad, 36 miles north of Eureka, 307 miles north of San Francisco, 680 miles northwest of downtown L.A.How much: Campsites run $25.50 to $40.80, but you need not sleep there to watch the elk.Info: Elk Country RV Resort","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:56:10.883Z","datePublished":"2017-12-06T14:00:00.000Z","headline":"Join the elks club near Trinidad’s classic red schoolhouse","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0c1e585/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+68/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F95%2F75%2F1d44d18a2d8dca2a9c49c6f3d21b%2Flat-tr-redwoods-la0017336250-20131002","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-california-bucket-list-updates-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Christopher Reynolds"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-california-bucket-list-updates-2017-htmlstory.html#join-the-elks-club-near-trinidads-classic-red-schoolhouse"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageWhy: Perched at the end of the rising desert floor, Font's Point givesonlookers a majestic view of California's badlands, several hundredfeet below.

The harbor, home to 9,000 vessels, is a recreational wonderland.The Duffy, a popular brand of rental boats, is an excellent way to see it all.

Lee (an officer of the Sanger Chamber of Commerce) asked President Coolidge to have this giant sequoia in the Grant Grove area of Kings Canyon designated the national Christmas tree. In 1926 the president complied. Ever since, the Sanger Chamber has staged an annual Trek to the Tree, drawing hundreds of people each year for a winter program that typically includes songs and prayers. No tinsel, no lights. Just the tree as it has stood for about 2,000 years, and a wreath contributed by park rangers.This year's event will be Sunday, Dec. 10, at the base of the tree. and it's a free admission day in the park.

So you'll probably have it to yourself.What: Your gateway to the Klamath River Overlook is Requa, a hamlet -- the memory of a town, really -- along the Highway 101 south of Crescent City in Del Norte County. Its main landmark is the Historic Requa Inn, a rustic riverside lodging and restaurant that dates to 1914. If you can work out a way to eat dinner and spend a night there, do it. But don't stop there. Continue west 1.5 miles (no RVs!) on ramshackle Requa Road (which becomes Patrick J. Murphy Memorial Road on some maps) until there's no more road, and no more land. That will put you at the Klamath River Overlook. Drink it in. And if it's May or June, scan the ocean for gray whales. Rangers say they often linger to feed in the waters spilling from river to seaThis bluff is part of Redwood National and State Parks and it includes a modest picnic area.

There's also a Coastal Trail to the north -- follow it for 2.7 miles and you'll reach Hidden Beach.But the wide view from the picnic tables may well be plenty for you.

And Thomas Keller, one of this nation's most admired chefs, has three restaurants in Yountville, on the same street. Or four. Or five, depending on how you count.What: Keller, raised and trained in Florida and New York and renowned for his high standards, has also cooked in acclaimed kitchens in France and Los Angeles, and he has operations in New York and Las Vegas as well. (His Bouchon in Beverly Hills is scheduled to close Dec. 31.) But since he opened the French Laundry in 1994, Yountville has been the seat of his California empire.  With three Michelin stars and a nine-course chef's menu, The French Laundry may be the most celebrated restaurant in the state, and it's surely one of the priciest. ImageBut the chef has give us options. Bouchon opened in 1998, offering French bistro fare. The Bouchon Bakery followed in 2003. In 2006 came Ad Hoc, devoted to American comfort food in a casual setting. (Its humble-brag slogan: \"for temporary relief from hunger.\") Ad Hoc's menu changes daily to take advantage of fresh ingredients, but it's all built around the chef's choice for a four-course family-style meal, which includes favorites like pot roast and barbecue. I came before 6 p.m. on buttermilk fried chicken night (a Monday), and found myself in a happily clamorous dining room, surrounded by families, confronting more food than I could eat. (I enjoyed the casual feeling, and I liked the chicken well enough. But I actually enjoyed the salad and cheese courses more — livelier flavors.) ImageEither before or after eating in Yountville, stroll Washington Street. At 6640 you'll find the French Laundry, fronted by an unassuming, two-story, stone-walled building with minimalist kitchen addition and its gardens across the street. You can even peek through the kitchen window, a long slit that reveals the team laboring fiercely over that evening's dishes. Next, at 6534 Washington, you pause by Bouchon (French bistro fare) and the yellow awning of Bouchon Bakery (6528 Washington), whose snacks are the most affordable way to sample Keller's empire.A few blocks farther south at 6476 Washington, you reach Ad Hoc, which has nine seats at the bar in addition to its many tables (open Thursday through Monday). And behind Ad Hoc, neighbored by picnic tables, is Addendum, an auxiliary space that serves box lunches to go on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.Where: Ad Hoc, 6476 Washington St., Yountville, Ca., 55 miles north of San Francisco's Ferry Building, 411 miles northwest of downtown L.A.How much: The nine-course dinner at the French Laundry: $310-$325 each.

It's a little, old resort town full of hot springs, so between wine-tasting excursions (and maybe the occasional bike ride) you can float listlessly in a steaming pool, untroubled by the faint scent of sulfur because you can feel the stress evaporating from your body. What: Samuel Brannan, a brash, controversial figure who became one of California's first millionaires in the Gold Rush, founded Calistoga in the 1860s, counting on the area's springs to draw tourists from San Fancisco. (In fact, he built a rail route from Vallejo to Calistoga, and the current Napa Valley Wine Train rolls on the Napa-St. Helena portion of that old route.) It was a clever impulse. The town (population: about 5,300) lives on as a resort escape, with hideaways like Calistoga Ranch, Dr. Wilkinson's and Indian Springs (perhaps the oldest continuously operating pool and spa facility in the state) all relying heavily on their hot springs.Though the Napa/Sonoma wildfires of October drew near, they never reached the town of Calistoga, and it remains handsome as ever. In early November, I spent a night and stepped from the chilly morning air into the Olympic-sized, 102-degree, steam-cloaked pool at  the 17-acre Indian Springs resort. It was pleasant.

And on the Napa Valley Wine Train, you have the chance to dine in style while the miles and wineries roll past. What: The train covers about 18 miles, running north alongside Highway 29 from the city of Napa through Yountville and Oakville to St. Helena. Along the way, depending on what you sign up for, you may stop to taste at one to three wineries, eat a three-course meal on board, and be back where you started in three to six hours. It's expensive but so very comfortable.And it's got complicated history. The rail route, first laid in the 1860s, had fallen idle by the 1980s. To get the new wine train rolling in 1989, its owners had to outmaneuver many Napa locals who feared a tourist invasion would ruin the affluent community's character. Skip forward now to 2015, when the train's management drew a storm of criticism for ejecting a group of guests, mostly African American, who were accused of being too loud. ImageIn late 2015, new owners took over the train. Then wildfires flared in October. They missed the train track, Highway 29 and the wineries along the route, but killed at least 41 people and destroyed thousands of homes and scores of businesses in Napa and Sonoma counties. By the time I showed up in early November, almost none of the damage was visible from the train. Napa was still in the early stages of recovery and the train was about half-full — unusual for the time of year.

Much smaller than San Francisco's food-centric Ferry Building but placed near the starting point of many popular Napa adventures, this foodie acre (about two-thirds the size of a football field) is a point of convergence for locals and tourists and a one-stop reminder that this wine country does more than make wine.What: The Oxbow Public Market opened in 2007, just in time to suffer from a national recession, the closure of COPIA (since rethought and reopened by the Culinary Institute of America) and construction-related disruptions of local traffic. Now those troubles are in the rear-view mirror, and a stroll around the marketplace introduces you to plenty of wine products but also duck tacos (at C Casa); American comfort food (Gott's Roadside); local seafood (Hog Island Oyster Co.); and assorted local fruits and vegetables (Hudson Greens & Goods).  On my early November visit, Hudson was showing off a 1,033-pound pumpkin. There were also plenty of signs thanking the first-responders for their work fighting that region's wildfires in October. (Though many homes and about two dozen wineries were lost or damaged in those fires, the vast majority of the area's 500 wineries had reopened by Nov. 8.)Besides browsing at the market, you can also rent a bike at the automatic Spinway stand just outside and pedal seven miles along the Napa River to Kennedy Park and back; or just toodle down 1st Street in downtown Napa, where the new, 183-room Archer Hotel is expected to open in December.Where: 610-644 1st St., Napa, 46 miles north of the San Francisco Ferry building,  401 miles northwest of downtown L.A.How much: C Casa tacos run $4.75-$9.

But those were not happy years.What: While immigration agents at Ellis Island were admitting most European arrivals within a few hours, the objective on Angel Island was \"to exclude new arrivals.\" Especially the Chinese, who were routinely held for weeks or months in crowded, dirty conditions. Historians say most eventually gained admission by claiming family connections to U.S. citizens -- but only after lengthy interrogations and often denials and later appeals. The old Immigration Station barracks, a mile's hike from Angel Island's main dock, joined the state park system in 1963 and was bolstered by a restoration and upgrade in 2009. If you arrive during the 20-22 hours per week that the Immigration Station is open, rangers can point you to the poetry etched (in Chinese characters) on the wooden barracks walls by immigrants as they waited in dire conditions, sleeping three deep on bunk beds. More than 120 poems were carved into the walls.\"Sadness kills the person in the wooden building,\" says one.\"Once you start to see it, you'll see it everywhere,\" said state parks interpreter Casey Dexter-Lee. Of roughly 200,000 annual visitors to the island, Dexter-Lee said, about one in ten gets to the Immigration Station,To get there on a weekend day under the current ferry schedule, take the 9:40am Blue&Gold ferry from San Francisco's Pier 41 to Angel island, arriving 10:05. Hike or ride a rental bike to the Immigration Station. (The well-signed, mile-long walking route includes 144 stairsteps.) Get lunch at the Cove Cafe. There's a 4 p.m. ferry back to Pier 41. (Or if you're in hurry, there's one at 12:30 p.m.)Where: The island is just south of Tiburon (in Marin County), 5 miles north of Alcatraz, 6 miles north of San Francisco's Pier 41, about 390 miles northwest of downtown L.A..

It's a rough-hewn old place dating to 1939 that has survived rock slides, arson fires and snows that reached to the roof. That it still exists is a bit of a miracle. That this mountain hangout is only an hour or so from downtown L.A. is also a dash of good fortune. It might be the quickest way to feel a million miles away.What: On weekends, Newcomb’s Ranch is more than a restaurant/bar, it’s a showroom of L.A.’s best and most dazzling motorcycles. Most of the action takes place in the parking lot, where the owners of the heavy metal — bikes and sports cars — line up their trophies. The vibe is casual and family-friendly.Inside, you’ll find a restaurant that is better that it has to be, given the lack of any competition on this remote, wiggly highway in the Angeles National Forest. ImageIn winter, look for the fireplace in the main dining room, across from the pool table. The rest of the year, stay outside, where the real show is. The patio tables are plentiful, and the staff moves quickly through breakfast and lunch. (Newcomb’s closes at 4 p.m.)The menu is basic. The best value is a half-sandwich-soup combo for $7.99. The Ortega burger ($12.49) is an after-market version of the basic cheeseburger, but with bacon and mild Ortega peppers. The chicken tenders ($11.99) are enough to feed two, and arrive crispy and hot.Newcomb’s is also popular with the hiking and camping crowd. Ten minutes up the road is Buckhorn, a first-come, first-serve Alpine campground dotted with redwoods.

It's got new, used and rare books on four levels — the rarest are locked up on the top level.Then move down a few doors to the new and used books and music at the Mad Monk Center for Anachronistic Media at 2454 Telegraph.

But a dusting of snow -- and the challenge of hiking in snowshoes -- gives the landscape a new feel.What: You never know with the weather these days, but Sequoia, 5,000 to 8,200 feet above sea level, has gotten plenty of snow over the years. Rangers lead 1-mile snowshoeing walks in the Giant Forest area on weekends when conditions are right. (They'll even provide free snow shoes -- the old-fashioned kind, made of wood and sinew.)At some point, odds are good you'll be reminded that the sequoias all around you are generally thicker than the tall redwoods on the coast. So even if the redwoods are taller, the sequoias can still lay claim to the title \"world's largest trees.\" You can't beat a hike at their feet with snow all around.If you'd rather hike on your own, you can rent snowshoes at Lodgepole Market, about 2 miles from Wuksachi Lodge, or bring your own. Last time I tried it, our group stayed inside the park at the Wuksachi Lodge, which opened in 1999. The lodge often offers overnight-and-showshoe-rental packages in winter. Don't go out without a trail map.Cross-country skis are also available. Sequoia's sibling park, Kings Canyon, also offers similar programs, along with overnight stays at the John Muir Lodge (buit in 1998).Where: Wuksachi Lodge, 64740 Wuksachi Way, Sequoia National Park, 227 miles north of downtown L.A.How much: The going rates for adult snowshoe rental in Sequoia are $14.50 for half a day, $18 for a full day.

It's surrounded by a shopping district in which Macy's vies with five other department stores (and dominates them all when it comes to holiday displays); the Westin St. Francis Hotel tends to high-dollar travelers and the Kimpton Sir Frances Drake tends to only-slightly-less-high-dollar travelers. The square's 2.6 acres (once a site of sand dunes) were set aside in about 1850, and its name came from the pro-Union demonstrators who massed there during the Civil War.

The inventory is so fresh that items are often warm on the shelves.What: Dong Phuong's top man, Tony Dang, started making tofu at the age of 7 in his native Vietnam. In 1991, he opened Dong Phuong Tofu in Westminster, selling to stores and restaurants across the Southland. Today the reach is nationwide — but thanks to the small grocery outlet next to the tofu-making facility, locals can still get the goods straight from the factory floor.Besides the company's own products, the store offers other specialty Asian items.

It’s been knocked around plenty in all the years since, but like a prize fighter it keeps bouncing back.The landmark pier was closed as recently as the 1990s, and reopened relatively recently, in 2008.

Along the way, look for bundles of mistletoe hanging from the sycamores. Image ImageFor a solid workout, take Crags Road, and walk into a shady valley toward Forest Trail. On the left, the reservoir. Continue on to the filming site for \"MASH\" (1972-1983). The distance from parking lot to the TV site is about two miles, much of it uphill.Once there, explore the remnants of one of television's most popular shows, including an old jeep and an ambulance, in a setting that stood in for the show's Korean War exteriors.On the way back, veer to the right for a tour of Malibu Creek’s water features. The dark ponds are lush and shady and a huge relief from the afternoon heat. It’s a wonderful location for a game of hide and seek, or just a picnic and a nap.As if that’s not enough, Malibu Creek is also the site of SoCal’s toughest trail run. Bulldog, a fire road located entirely inside the park, climbs nearly 1,800 feet over almost 4 torturous miles.

It's Vegas -- except that you're in Riverside County, among the rock-studded hills, wine country and Temecula suburbs.

Its zendo, cottages, baths and trails are a tonic for what ails us.What: From late April or May through September, visitors join students and monks who live year-round at the end of a 14-mile dirt road that rises out of the Carmel Valley, snakes along a precipitous ridge line and drops into a beautiful sycamore- and oak-clad canyon. It’s Shangri-La with a California twist. Reservations are made through the San Francisco Zen Center, and while the atmosphere may seem a little forbidding (no cell coverage, limited electricity, a modest dress code, no pets), the staff is friendly and hospitable. The 2018 season will be April 26-Sept. 9.Accommodations range from cottages of river stone to clapboard cabins, from a yurt to a dormitory with communal dining.

His alluring black-and-white photo shows two well-dressed young women lounging in a glass-walled living room while the house appears to precariously perch on the edge of a mountain.What: Pass through the front door of architect Pierre Koenig's Stahl House — also known as Case Study House No. 22 — and prepare to gasp. Before you is a dazzling view that sweeps uninterrupted across the Los Angeles basin, from downtown L.A. to Santa Monica Bay and, on a clear day, beyond to Catalina Island. Laid out immediately at your feet is a courtyard consisting of a sleek, angular pool surrounded by smooth concrete. This is the first “room\" you enter.Wandering around the rest of the site doesn’t take long. It’s a small two-bedroom/two-bathroom. What does take time is absorbing the visuals of the place. The structure is post-and-beam but built with steel (instead of wood), glass and concrete. Because most of the walls are windows, it makes for jaw-dropping panoramic views and light-filled rooms. My suggestion is as soon as you finish exploring the place, take a seat somewhere and just gaze for as long as you possibly can. Then exhale. It’s tranquil up there.Koenig, the man behind this transparent home, was a Northern California boy who studied architecture at USC. On his way up to modernist stardom, he met with Clarence \"Buck\" Stahl, a family man who had made an international-style model of a house he wanted built on his West Hollywood hillside property. Koenig was natural fit for the job with his predilection for affordable, industrial materials. He was also a risk-taker — willing to take on a site some considered unbuildable. In 1960, the home was completed. Today, it’s considered a masterpiece of Midcentury Modern design.Tours take place three times a day: mid-afternoon, late afternoon and evening. The owners allow only a small number of guests per visit. A docent is there to answer questions and inform.Where: 1635 Woods Drive, Los Angeles, about 200 yards north of the Chateau Marmont Hotel on Sunset Boulevard, about 10 miles northwest of downtown L.A. How much: Tickets run $35-$90 depending on what time of day you attend a tour and with how many people.

If you’re already a believer, you’ll be in your element.What: Casa del Herrero (House of the Blacksmith), a 1925 home designated a National Historic Landmark in 2009, lets you peek into California, Spanish and Moorish homes and history. George and Carrie Steedman (pronounced sted-man) of St. Louis decamped to build their Spanish Colonial Revival dream house on 11 acres. If its design looks familiar, it’s because architect George Washington Smith designed nearly six dozen homes and some commercial buildings in the area. Their collaboration was like genius squared.

Open the door and you’re transported to southern Spain and its Moorish influences. The rooms reflect an Iberian shopping spree that filled the house with 13th and 17th century furnishings, tapestries and more.Not all the objects could be used for their original purpose, so parchment pages from a 15th century Gregorian chant choir book became lampshades; a door designed for a sacristy in a small town outside of Seville, Spain, goes to a linen closet.The living room adheres to the notions of entertaining not in the 1920s but in Spain: Chairs line the walls, and tables in the middle are used for refreshments. It is no wonder the Steedmans did much of their entertaining outside.The gardens — the outdoor rooms, really — reflect a panoply of influences, some European, some Californian, some practical and some aesthetic, and they provided ample floral fodder for Carrie Steedman, whose more than 300 flower-designing ribbons hang in an area her husband set aside for her in his workshop.George Steedman’s genius is most evident in that workshop, his version of a man cave. His fortune came from manufacture of munitions in World War I, and his abilities with metal translated into the creation of numerous touches, including finials he copied, then cast here; silver chargers used in table settings that he created and engraved; a barbecue grill that could be disassembled and reassembled for easy transport to the back grounds for a cookout.

In good years, bright orange covers the earth as far as the eye can see. Legends of these sunny blooms are woven into the myths of native tribes, Spanish conquistadors and 49ers.Not surprisingly, the California poppy became a state flower in 1903. Around this time, residents cherished the springtime tradition of picnics among poppy fields, much like cherry blossom gazing in Japan. Today, the flowers have few open places to create such spectacles.  Peak bloom falls around California Poppy Day on April 6, but the timing, intensity, and duration of poppy blooms vary from season to season, depending on the season's temperatures and rainfall.The park, which has 8 miles of gentle trails to explore, is open from sunrise to sunset.

But for those seeking the soul of skateboarding: Venice.This 18,000-square foot concrete playground, built on a rise of sand in the heart of Venice Beach, attracts skate-travelers from around the world.

Accommodations include separate-sex or coed bunkrooms and private rooms for individuals, couples or families.Or plan a long daytime stop on your road trip to the Bay Area. Gray, blue and humpback whales are all visible from the viewing area on the point (bring binoculars) and 50 species of migratory and native birds use this as their hostel too.Tide pools are a short walk north from the complex, located on a series of jagged bluffs on this photogenic stretch of coastal highway.Though the lighthouse itself is closed to tours, its original lens is on display at ground level.

He also made puppets for clients around the globe and was a rare mentor in a fading profession.In 2009, the theater was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Landmark. Though the troupe and building faced uncertainty after Baker's death in 2014 at 90, the puppeteers have reorganized as a nonprofit venture, and a capital campaign is underway to renovate the theater.

Sometimes you don’t want to be around other people. All you crave is a country road and an epic piece of pie. For all that, come to Duarte’s Tavern in tiny Pescadero, near Half Moon Bay, for a simple yet memorable dinner and a frosty drink. Make this rustic jewel your hamlet, your hideout, your Walden Pond.What: Duarte’s (pronounced Doo-arts) has been serving up generous plates of no-nonsense, straight-from-the-garden food for almost 125 years. Since 1894, when the founder tapped a keg of cheap whisky to today, when it serves up to 10,000 customers a month, this farm country landmark has delivered memorable meals at affordable prices. ImageThe glow-stick exterior dominates the little town of Pescadero, in rolling, sparsely populated farm country two miles from the coast. Inside, you’ll realize that the Duarte family was ahead of their time, with a reliance on locally sourced vegetables, beef and fish.There’s no ego to the dishes: Pork chops and fresh applesauce is a headliner, as is the snapper and chips. The soups arrive robust and steamy, hours from the restaurant’s own garden out back.The tavern/restaurant is still run by the fourth generation of the Portuguese family that founded it. In 2003, it won a James Beard Award for its faithfulness to classic country cooking and a body of work that spans three centuries.Oh, and there’s pie. Good Lord, is there pie.

Indeed, the Tramway Gas Station sat under this great tilting zooming top for decades, until (like a lot of Palm Springs) the building fell into idleness and blight in the 1970s and 1980s.Then a few mavens of Desert Modernism effected a rescue — a story repeated on properties all over the Coachella Valley over the last 25 years.

And because the building stands 200 feet offshore on a tiny island, you can only get there at low tide.What: The Battery Point Lighthouse (now also a museum) turned its light on in 1856, two years after California's first lighthouse opened at Alcatraz. It was automated in 1953 and survived the 1964 tsunami that devastated Crescent City. It's now managed by the Del Norte County Historical Society.When the tide is low (consult the web or call [707] 464-3089 to check), you can walk to the lighthouse across the sand, rocks and a cement driveway.

For several fraught moments in the first \"Blade Runner\" film (1982), Harrison Ford ducks and scuttles through this building as spotlights rake the atrium. In an enduring cinematic vision of L.A. as dystopia, this was some of the spookiest stuff.What: The Bradbury Building, completed in 1893 and dramatically restored about 100 years later, seems to be the oldest remaining commercial building in downtown L.A. The Bradbury rents out office space (several private investigators are tenants), and film shoots and other events have been frequent through the years. Last December, the Da Camera Society brought in the Boston Camerata for two chamber music performances.Some people credit architect Sumner Hunt for the building's glories; others say it's because construction supervisor George H.

It’s easy to call Enchanted a holiday light display, but that’s not quite right. There are no symbols of the season, no elves, no jolly St. Nicks. It’s more the suggestion of the ethereal that charms.As you walk the pathways (wear comfortable shoes, please), you may begin to wonder: Do the giant redwoods shimmer blue and green because they’re illuminated that way or because they’ve been drenched with a kind of liquid fairy dust? Do the maples in the Japanese garden glow red because their natural charm has been enhanced by electrical means or because they’ve perpetually donned their autumnal best for the occasion?You can fortify yourself before with an on-site dinner of American fare at Maple restaurant.

This hilltop home -- officially, the Aline Barnsdall Hollyhock House -- is one of them. And unlike many Wright homes, it's open for tours.What: The house, Wright's first Los Angeles commission, was completed in 1921 for an artsy oil heiress named Aline Barnsdall. Wright called the style \"California Romanza,\" but it looks a lot like a Mayan mansion with a prime view of the Hollywood Hills and Griffith Park. Inspect that view closely, and you'll notice, 1.4 miles due north, the patterned concrete blocks of another Wright project, the Ennis House, now privately owned.In any event, Wright's client didn't care for it much. In 1927 she donated 11 acres, including the home and some neighboring structures, to the City of Los Angeles. Today the compound serves as Barnsdall Art Park, busy with classes for youths and adults (and Friday-night wine-tasting in summer months). Hollyhock House, reopened in 2015 after years of fundraising and restoration, is neighbored by an art gallery, studio and theater space, the slopes planted with olive trees. The home's former garage now serves a visitor center and gift shop.The home is open for self-guided tours on Thursdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Last ticket sold at 3:30 p.m.) It is wheelchair-accessible, but there's no air-conditioning, so when interior temperatures reach 90 degrees, they close. Where: Barnsdall Art Park, 4800 Hollywood Blvd., five miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.How much: Tickets are $7 for adults, $3 for seniors and students, free for children under 12 with a paying adult at the visitor center (Visa and Mastercard only).

The result is a \"tree chapel\" that blurs distinctions between inside and outside, spirituality and nature.  Many architects call this style Modern Organic. Whatever language you prefer, it's nice to see the sky from inside the sanctuary. The locally quarried stone adds an earthy touch.

In 2017, yoga (gentle and Kundalini) was offered on Tuesday and Wednesday nights from May through September; check the chapel website to see if that continues in 2018. The chapel is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; the visitor center, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Because the site is heavily booked with weddings, baptisms and memorials at 10 a.m., 12 p.m., 2 p.m. and so on (especially on weekends), the best time to get a look inside is to show up at 9 a.m., 11 a.m., 1 p.m. or 3 p.m.  — the odd hours.

In early December, it will be 50 years since the grand old lady arrived to begin her retirement years in Long Beach Harbor as a floating hotel, restaurant and special-events venue. Since she needs as much as $289 million in work, there's no telling how much longer this retirement will last.What: The ship is more than 1,000 feet long, with 12 decks and three smokestacks. Converted into a troop ship and painted gray during World War II, the Queen Mary could carry up to 16,683 soldiers and sailors. She resumed civilian service after the war, but before long the rise of air travel largely destroyed demand for transatlantic passenger ships. In late 1967, the ship made her 1,001st (and final) transatlantic voyage and settled into her current location. The City of Long Beach's plan was to boost tourism.The years since have been bumpy. The Queen Mary has had  success with seasonal attractions like the  Dark Harbor program that runs through Nov. 1. But beneath those spooky trappings, the ship is genuinely suffering from extensive structural corrosion. Without dramatic repairs, experts have warned, an internal collapse could come within 10 years.But there's no place quite like it on the West Coast, and the ship's operators have been talking up some ambitious plans.  If you're not ready to spend the night or brave Dark Harbor, the hour-long Glory Days Historical Tour is offered eight times per day, every day. Where: 1126 Queens Highway, Long Beach, 25 miles south of downtown L.A.How much: A one-day Passport (which includes self-guided exploration, access to the model ship gallery, a \"4-D\" theater presentation and the Glory Days Historical Tour or an alternative called Haunted Encounters) costs $27 and up (plus service fees) per adult, $17.50 and up (plus service fees) per child aged 4-11.

The dozens of practical and affordable Korean spas are less known, tucked away in office buildings throughout Koreatown and beyond. Wi Spa is the granddaddy of them all. What: Wi Spa is a modern bathhouse with roots in the ancient Korean tradition of communal bathing and sweating. For a modest admission price, you have access to a megaplex of relaxation with saunas and baths, hair and nail salons, a gym, a full-service restaurant, TV and lounge areas, sleeping rooms, a manga library, a skin-care boutique, open-air terrace, computer room, kids zone and a coed communal heated room known as jimjilbang (or sometimes jjimjilbang). Stay for an hour or lounge all day — you'll leave renewed. And you may learn how to fold a towel into a yang mori (lamb's head) hat.  ImageSpa etiquette can be intimidating, but you won’t have any trouble if you follow two basic rules: Take your shoes off before entering the spa area and wash yourself in a shower before entering a tub or sauna, which includes rinsing after every sweat session. Nudity is required in the gender-segregated floors, but everyone receives a T-shirt and shorts for the jimjilbang. This is the living room of the spa, where patrons of all ages relax together on the heated floors. Here, specialty saunas —  including the 231-degree bulgama and the clay ball room — line the walls.After you sweat it out, try the signature Korean body scrub, called the buff, to experience a no-frills whole body exfoliation well worth the gruff handling. Top off your stay with the shareable patbingsu — a swell of shaved ice covered in condensed milk, sweet red beans, fruit and mochi.  Wi Spa never closes, and makes a great choice for a spa day if you are new to the experience, bringing the kids along, or want a wide range of spa amenities. Other nearby options include Natura Spa; Olympic Spa (women only); and Spa Palace, for a less crowded, smaller version of Wi Spa. Where: 2700 Wilshire Blvd. in downtown L.A. How much: $25 admission, waived with a service over $120.

Forty years later, that home (which he still owns) is an icon of deconstructivism, and a pilgrimage point for young architects and students of design.You can't go closer than the sidewalk — it's a private home. But you can drive by slowly or park and walk the block.What: Gehry (whose 89th birthday is Feb. 28, 2018) was still a largely unknown name when he and his wife bought the house at 22nd Street and Washington Avenue in the late 1970s. It was a 1920s Dutch Colonial, two stories on a corner lot, in a middle-class neighborhood that was part single-family homes, part apartment buildings.Then Gehry went to work. Soon the place had corrugated metal walls, irregular angles, protruding glass cubes, plywood panels, chain-link rectangles — on a block of suburban style and 90-degree angles, it looked like a satellite crash. As the story goes, the neighbors were outraged. A few decades later, some rough edges have been softened by landscaping and another big renovation in the early 1990s. Zillow thinks just about every house on the block is worth more than $2 million. And Gehry's name is known around the world. But how long will this Gehry Residence belong to the Gehry family?

His death in 1876 ended the idea of a grand greenhouse, and it sat until a group of San Franciscans, including Leland Stanford and Charles Crocker, bought it and donated it to the city. It opened in 1879. ImageIts life has been no bed of roses. At least one explosion, a fire and a windstorm have damaged it, sometimes closing it for long stretches, although oddly enough, it survived the 1906 earthquake unscathed. Still, in the 1990s, it landed on the World Monuments Fund's list of endangered sites. But it was saved, once again, by a fundraising effort.Today the conservatory is thought to be the largest such structure in the world, and on days when the sun is out, it seems like a gleaming white symbol of tenacity.Inside, you’ll find the familiar (anthurium, orchids and hibiscus), the exotic (chenille and lipstick plants) and the odd (the Dracula orchid and the corpse flower, which bloomed in June). You can watch a time lapse of the opening of the odiferous corpse flower. Fortunately, you cannot smell it.The conservatory also has special exhibits (Butterflies and Blooms through Jan. 8) and special events (an Oct. 19 Dracula Orchid Ball — Gala Under Glass) that keep the experience different for repeat visitors.Where: Golden Gate Park on John F. Kennedy Drive, about 385 miles northwest of downtown Los AngelesHow much: $9 for adults, $6 for seniors 65 and older and youth 12-17, $3 for children 5-11 and free for children 4 and younger.

Or blame the Beach Boys for deciding to sing about it in the early 1960s. Either way, the word got out about this sport, which can be fatal or, in the best of circumstances, not so hard.I admired it from afar until the other day, when I signed on for a 90-minute, one-on-one lesson at beginner-friendly Mission Beach in San Diego. Instructor Adam Wiegand took me through the basics, launched me into a few waves, then went ashore and hollered instructions at me, the 56-year-old rookie. It wasn't pretty, but I got up a few times and spent some precious seconds gliding with the tide. This means it's not that hard.It does help to start on a day of 1-2-foot waves, using a 10-foot-long foam board — that's about the size of an aircraft carrier.

But it reopened in 2015 and as you surmount its 157 steps, you'll hear how Balboa Park has grown from a temporary fairground into one of the nation's foremost urban parks. You'll also get a bird's-eye view of the signature tiled dome that's also part of the California Tower.What: The tower and dome are both part of the Museum of Man, one of 17 cultural organizations in the park. If you sign up to climb the tower, your guide will remind you how the 1,200-acre park began as a venue for the Panama-California Exposition of 1915, San Diego's underdog effort to compete with San Francisco's Panama-Pacific International Exposition the same year. San Francisco's expo was fancier, but when those parties were over, San Diego set aside more acreage, preserved more buildings and may have reaped more long-term benefits. ImageAnyway, the tour lasts about 40 minutes. It's fun to climb the narrow spiral staircase (and a tad disappointing to learn that the highest levels of the tower are off-limits). The observation deck, about 100 feet above the ground floor, looks out on the redwood lattice of the Botanical Building; the not-so-native trees shading the not-so-native animals of the zoo; the curlicued Spanish Colonial Revival facades of the Prado; the roofs of the Old Globe; and the Cabrillo Bridge, also built for the long-ago expo.Within a short walk of the tower, you'll find the Fleet Science Center, the Museum of Photographic Arts, the San Diego Natural History Museum, the San Diego History Center, the San Diego Museum of Art, the Japanese Friendship Garden and more.  In fact, it you haven't given Balboa Park at least half a day, you've probably fouled up your San Diego vacation.Where: 1350 El Prado, San Diego, 123 miles southeast of downtown L.A.How much: Tower tour tickets (which also include museum admission) cost $22.50 per adult, $18 for students over 12, $10 for students and children age 6-12.

A tall fence runs into the ocean and shore birds perch on it. A second fence runs parallel. Border Patrol agents circulate in SUVs and on ATVs, making sure nobody climbs over or swims around. Antennas reach skyward. Cellphones lose bearings. Through the fence, you might glimpse Mexican families romping on the beach. What: Border Field State Park's 418 acres include the beach, views of a few rocky offshore islands and Monument Mesa, which has shaded picnic tables and a broad view of the wetlands, scrub and several horse stables on the U.S. side. The Mexican side features a bull ring, a lighthouse and several hillside developments. Authorities don't recommend swimming on the U.S. side (no lifeguard; low water quality after rains). But you can ride horses, which is rare on California beaches.In dry weather between 9:30 a.m. and 6 p.m., the flood-prone road into the park is usually open, allowing you to drive almost all the way to the beach. When the road's gate is closed,  it's about a 1.5-mile walk to the beach and a few yards farther to the mesa, which includes Friendship Park.What's Friendship Park? It might be this border's strangest feature of all: an enclosed segment of fence where Mexicans and Americans can meet and converse (no hand-offs, no filming) through openings in the metal barrier, as a U.S. Border Patrol agent looks on. The area is open 10 a.m to 2 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.If you want to drive into Mexico via San Ysidro, stay on I-5, bring a passport and buy Mexican insurance first.

Artist Leo Villareal, who conceived the twinkling spectacle, calls it The Bay Lights. The work was first displayed from 2013 to 2015, then returned as a permanent feature in January 2016. About 25,000 programmed white lights are involved — but you can't see them from the bridge itself.Instead, you can see them from across the water — perhaps the Ferry Building, or almost anywhere along the Embarcadero (including the long boardwalk of Pier 7). Or you could admire them from aboard a ferry.You can ride from the Ferry Building to Oakland's Jack London Square (via Alameda) in 30 to 35 minutesAs you watch the lights dance on the vertical cables toward the west end of the bridge, remember that the Bay Bridge is really more a sequence of bridges, connecting San Francisco to Oakland by way of Yerba Buena Island, with about a quarter-million cars crossing daily.

But it is a beach and city park in Laguna Beach. It's sometimes overlooked because it wraps around the exclusive Montage resort (most rooms cost $800 a night or more). But Treasure Island has a shaded parking structure (whose roughly 30 spaces fill up early ever day), a pleasant bluff-top path alongside the resort's immaculate landscaping, public benches, picnic spots with 180-degree ocean views, tide pools and white-sand shores that include a dramatic sandstone arch.About the name: In the 1930s, this beach was used as shooting location for a movie version of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel \"Treasure Island.\" Later, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz used the spot in their 1954 vacation road-trip movie, \"The Long, Long Trailer.\" The Montage site once held a trailer park.The last time I was there, on a weekday in late September, I scored one of those coveted parking spots. We picnicked on a bench atop the bluff, clowned around under the arch, then spotted a seal (or maybe it was a sea lion) in the shallows by the rocks. You won't find a tidier beach or bluff top. Look north and you'll spot Victoria Beach and the eccentric 1920s \"pirate tower\" that rises from the shoreline there. (Be warned, however, that PCH is always busy and parking is always in short supply in Laguna Beach. Street parking is probably your best bet.) ImageIf you want to be sure your beach day includes a marine mammal, stop off at the Pacific Marine Mammal Center, 5 miles north of Treasure Island Park on Laguna Canyon Road.

While Old Town and Balboa Park grab tourists in vast numbers, Liberty Station draws more locals.

In between you have Highway 1 and this graceful span, a man-made respite between coastal wonders. But the highway is highly vulnerable to landslides, which is why, through mid-2018, Southern Californians need to approach Bixby Bridge by way of a big detour.What: Highway 1 through Big Sur covers about 90 miles, beginning above San Simeon and continuing north to just below Carmel. The stormy winter of 2016-2017 damaged the road in multiple spots, now reduced to one closed zone at Mud Creek, about 20 miles northwest of San Simeon. (Those landslide damage repairs are due to conclude in June 2018). Still, most of Big Sur's scenery and businesses are open and accessible. Bixby Bridge is a highlight of the northern portion.To reach the Bixby Bridge, the Rocky Point Restaurant, Point Lobos, Carmel and other points north, drive north on the 101 from Southern California. Then double back through Monterey via Highway 68. Soon you'll be hugging that amazing Big Sur coastline. Bear in mind that some trails are open in Andrew Molera and Garrapata state parks but much territory is closed or tightly restricted as repairs continue. The other detour alternative: Drive north from Southern California on 101, then exit at Jolon Road (north of Paso Robles) and continue via Nacimiento-Fergusson Road to join the Highway 1 above the closed section. Now, about Bixby Bridge: It was completed in 1932, a masterpiece built by the lowest bidder for a government contract. Its roadway runs about 260 feet above Bixby Creek and the waves below. Even if you pass over without pausing, it feels as though you're in the middle of something special.There is a turnout space just north of the bridge (it's called Castle Rock Viewpoint), and it has room for a dozen cars. But if you're driving on a weekend, especially in summer, it'll probably be full. If you you arrive amid less traffic and see a spot, do pull off the road and soak up the panorama. For a different perspective, cross the highway when it's safe and walk a few hundred yards inland on less-trafficked Old Coast Road, also just north of the span. Where: The bridge stands along Highway 1, 15 miles south of Carmel, 336 miles northwest of downtown L.A. (if you arrive via the 101 and 68). Before any driving on Highway 1 in Big Sur, check conditions with Caltrans.How much: Free.

It often features hundreds, sometimes thousands, of portly pinnipeds flopped on the sand at the Piedras Blancas Elephant Seal Rookery.What: An uncanny bellowing beckoned me off the road last winter. On that trip, I joined a crowd on a boardwalk looking down in delight and wonder as these mega-sized marine mammals jockeyed for dominance on the beach. (Males get up to 5,000 pounds and 16 feet long, and this was mating and birthing season.) In the spring, we found a second visit equally intriguing: molting season. The beach was full of tan, brown and silvery lumps that looked like driftwood, until one would yawn or another would toss cooling sand over its hot, heavy body.   ImageIt was the early 1990s when growing numbers of Northern elephant seals (so called because of the mature male's large nose) began gathering here. Since then (with support from many conservation organizations) the lumbering beasts have claimed about six miles of shoreline as a haven for birthing , breeding, molting and rest. Though the elephant seals spend most of their lives at sea, there’s something happening here most months. In September and October, for example, young ones arrive for the fall haul-out. There are several vista points, some wheelchair-friendly, and blue-jacketed Friends of the Elephant Seal volunteers are often on hand to answer questions. You can take a wildflower walk along the coastal trail north of the vista points or sign up for a tour of the Piedras Blancas Light Station.

Since the 1830s, this mission has been a major center for storage of mission system records, which makes the place popular with scholars.The site includes a nine-room museum, library and archive.But if you loved Karana, the brave hero of \"Blue Dolphins,\" you might head straight for the cemetery. This is where mission leaders buried Juana Maria, a native woman who was found alone on San Nicolas Island in 1853, about 50 years old. She had apparently endured 18 years of solitude and weather. She lasted about seven weeks after her return to the mainland, then perished from dysentery.Though her grave is unmarked, the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution placed a memorial plaque. When O' Dell heard the story, he launched into research, made the protagonist younger and published his book in 1960.

From September through June, there are plenty of school programs aimed at fourth-graders studying California history.What: The town was born in 1850 when prospectors found gold. By 1860, its best days as a source of gold were over. By the 1930s, it was on the brink of collapse. The state stepped in to acquire land and make Columbia a park in 1945.

About four hours from Los Angeles, the old Dutch bakery is a must-stop on the half-day ride into the Eastern Sierra. A travel touchstone for generations, Schat’s famed sheepherder bread was developed in 1938 to please Basque farmers who missed the bread of their homeland. Almost 80 years later, stopping for a loaf of the hand-shaped bread remains a California tradition. Oh, and don’t forget the chocolate macarons.What: Schat’s big bakery is the focal point of a Main Street that features no-frills bars and fishing tackle shops. The bakery/deli offers sandwiches and pastries for the road for travelers heading to Mammoth Lakes or Yosemite. A beautiful city park across the street allows for impromptu picnics and a chance to stretch your legs.The magic? The Sierra snowmelt that filters into the groundwater, and eventually into the famed breads. Stone-ground flour also is a key ingredient, and pecans and other nuts are provided by local growers.The place is so popular that parking can be a little tricky, but there are usually spots at the far end of the lot. Inside, lines can be long. You can be in and out in a flash by passing up the long lines in front and paying at secondary registers farther back in the store.While the sheepherder bread is the go-to delicacy, the fresh sourdough and apple tarts are popular as well. The feel-good vibe of this old European-style bakery is one of the joys of any Western road trip.Where: 763 N.

After that, good luck.But there are reasons the lot is full and lines at the deli counter can run 45 minutes or more. First of all, it’s more than a deli; Bay Cities is a specialty Italian grocery. In New York or Philly, it wouldn’t be such a novelty. But here….And, really, it’s all about the Godmother. Get it with the works, and peppers, mild or hot.

Plenty of restaurants and shops are lined up on Manhattan Beach Boulevard, the main drag. At the end of the boulevard, the concrete Manhattan Beach Pier reaches 928 feet into the sea, with a cafe and the small, kid-friendly Roundhouse Aquarium at the end.The volleyball happens on the sand courts just north and south of the pier.

Five (including Santa Cruz) are part of Channel Islands National Park. At just 11 miles from Ventura Harbor, Scorpion Anchorage on Santa Cruz Island offers the best introduction to the park. Most visitors arrive via one-hour boat ride. Ashore, there's potable water, picnic tables, some of the islands' best weather and plenty to do. You can visit for a day or camp for several. Often referred to as \"the Galápagos of North America,\" the archipelago is home to 145 species of flora and fauna found nowhere else. On Santa Cruz, keep an eye out for the highly visible (and tiny) island foxes and island scrub jays. Also, though it seems so far from civilization, the island has a 10,000-plus-year history of Chumash habitation, along with half a millennium of European exploration and nearly 200 years of ranching. The visitor center at the historic Scorpion Ranch house offers information on all these topics, guided hikes and other free interpretive programs. (Also, back on the mainland, check out the park's Robert J. Lagomarsino Visitor Center at Channel Islands National Park in Ventura.)The summer and fall are ideal times to kayak, snorkel and swim at the beach at Scorpion Anchorage. Kayak transportation must be arranged before departure (use Channel Island Kayak Center for rentals). Guided tours and snorkel gear rentals are available through Channel Islands Adventure Company. Reservations are recommended, but walk-ups on the island may be available, especially for snorkel gear. If water sports aren't your thing, Santa Cruz island offers superb hiking from Scorpion Anchorage, from a two-mile loop along majestic sea cliffs to an eight-mile trek into the island interior. The island offers no food service (except for a few snacks on the boat), so bring your own, and pack out all of your trash. Depending on weather, boat departures may be canceled, so always check the status of your trip before you travel. Also, wind, currents and weather can make for rough boat crossings, so make sure to take some Dramamine if you are prone to seasickness.

But it's between San Luis Obispo and San Diego that most of the coastline happens. The Pacific Surfliner route takes about nine hours if you stay aboard the whole way, but you might want to pick a shorter portion of the trip, focusing on, say, the rugged beaches of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties, or the upscale shoreline in southern Orange and northern San Diego counties. (Near downtown L.A. you'll get a dose of heavy industry and a river encased in concrete.)The stations are part of the thrill too. The mustard-hued Santa Barbara station along State Street is a handsome piece of Spanish Colonial architecture that was well-restored several years ago. L.A.'s Union Station is a marvelous collision of Spanish Colonial and Art Deco.

The town of Angels Camp, still sleepy and surrounded by hills that turn a gorgeous green in spring, stages a frog-jumping contest during the county fair every spring -- in 2018, May 17-20. ImageNo matter when you turn up, you can catch up on past results by reading the sidewalk plaques of the Frog Hop of Fame along Main Street.

All of that culminates in a nail-biting final ascent up 400 feet of metal cables, a harrowing endeavor that will challenge your arm strength, endurance and nerves. What: There are two main ways to summit Half Dome: the Mist Trail (14 miles round trip) or the John Muir Trail (16 miles round trip). When I did the hike last June, the plan was to go up the Mist Trail and down the JMT, but after hours of hiking, the thought of tacking on additional mileage — even if it was less steep — became less appealing.Either way, you're looking at a gnarly 4,800 feet of elevation gain. For most hikers, the round trip takes 10 to 12 hours.Hiking Half Dome involves a fair amount of logistical and physical advance prep. First, you'll need a permit to climb the cables. There are two ways to obtain one: during the preseason lottery (apply online in March; learn your results in mid-April) or through a daily lottery during the hiking season, which typically begins around Memorial Day and ends around Columbus Day, depending on weather conditions. A maximum of 300 hikers are allowed a day: 225 day hikers, and 75 backpackers. With tens of thousands of people applying, be prepared for disappointment: According to the National Park Service, the success rate last year for preseason lottery applicants was just 3.4% on weekends and 10% on weekdays; for the daily lottery, it was 12% on weekends and 31% on weekdays.To get in shape for Half Dome, plan to do several training hikes in the preceding months — a loop around Runyon the week before isn't going to cut it. Wake up early, pack a backpack and get a feel for what it's like to be out on the trail all day. Good training hikes in Southern California include the Six-Pack of Peaks (Mt. Wilson, Cucamonga Peak, Mt. Baldy, San Bernardino Peak, Mt. San Jacinto and San Gorgonio). Build up your arm strength with weights and resistance exercises. ImageBring a good pair of hiking boots, at least four liters of water, grippy gloves (although there is a pile of discarded gloves at the base of the cables), sunscreen, lunch, snacks, a flashlight or headlamp, mosquito repellent and a first-aid kit. Some hikers use a harness and clips to attach themselves to the cables, but most haul themselves up without.Where: The hike begins on the valley floor. There’s a parking lot, or you can walk to the trailhead from the Happy Isles shuttle stop (about a half-mile away) or from Half Dome Village (about three-quatrers of a mile away). Note that shuttle service doesn’t begin until 7 a.m.How much: It costs $10 to apply for a permit, and another $10 if you win the lottery. Park admission is $30 per vehicle for a seven-day pass.Info: Half Dome Permits at Yosemite National Park","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:49:08.548Z","datePublished":"2017-09-06T13:00:00.000Z","headline":"Stand atop Yosemite’s most famous icon with a hike to the summit of Half Dome","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ae54b2a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/800x450+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F00%2Fd4%2F7d44ca21dd15b95cd80fcb2555b2%2F800","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-california-bucket-list-updates-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Andrea Chang"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-california-bucket-list-updates-2017-htmlstory.html#stand-atop-yosemites-most-famous-icon-with-a-hike-to-the-summit-of-half-dome"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageWhy: Everyone needs a pit stop or two along Highway 395, the often-drab drive from L.A. to the Eastern Sierra.

Meanwhile, above ground, cows graze and cyclists zoom down two-lane roads. In its beauty, fragility and increasing wealth, this is an emblematic piece of the Bay Area.What: Seismologists say the peninsula sits atop the Pacific plate, which slowly lurches to the northwest while the North American plate (on the other side of Highway 1) lurches to the southwest. The seam between those plates is the San Andreas fault , California's most notorious physical flaw, stretching about 800 miles north and up to 10 miles deep from the Salton Sea to Mendocino County. Consider its disastrous potential as you walk the Point Reyes National Seashore's 0.6-mile Earthquake Trail (wheelchairs and dogs welcome), which starts near the seashore's Bear Valley Visitor Center and leads to a reconstructed fence that was displaced 16 feet in 40 seconds in the quake of 1906.  Or just look at Tomales Bay, which follows the path of the fault.But even if you have no head for seismology, there's the pastoral scenery and a medley of smalls towns to admire — mile upon mile of shapely hills that once were dominated by dairy farms.

Afterward, you’ll have a great appreciation for the words “catawampus” and “Call of the Wild.”What: Heinold’s First and Last Chance Saloon, which dates to 1883, sits in  at the edges of the now presentable Jack London Square in Oakland. Thanks to the 1906 earthquake, the bar sank irreparably and now requires a step down. Inside the slanting saloon — especially sitting at the bar — you can feel drunk even when you’re completely sober. ImageThe other reason to visit: Writer Jack London used to hang out here, perhaps to escape his dismal, impoverished life in Oakland, where he lived with his mother, Flora, and his stepfather, John, whose surname he took. Jack quit school at 14, had some adventures and later decided he wanted to go to UC Berkeley after returning from a failed Klondike Gold Rush adventure. He taught himself the high-school subjects in a year (he studied in Heinold’s) and off he went, financed, it’s said, by Johnny Heinold, the bar’s owner. London left college after a year to write — novels, magazine articles, short stories and more.If you went to high school, you’ve surely encountered “Call of the Wild” (1903), considered London’s best, and “White Fang” and “The Sea Wolf,” drawn from his Alaskan adventures. Heinold’s gets a nod or two in “John Barleycorn,” which details the writer’s relationship with booze.London died in 1916. He was 40 years old.A mural on one side of Heinold’s displays this quote: “The proper function of man is to live, not to exist.” Based on London’s  adventures — sailing to Japan, being a hobo and bumming around the U.S., searching for gold — he appears to have done that.

ImageMaybe it was because Giannini didn’t come from high finance. He started in the wholesale produce business. Then, in San Francisco in 1904, he founded the Bank of Italy, which not only survived the great quake of 1906, but by the late 1920s had become the Bank of America via merger. Giannini’s growing venture, bolstered by a network of branches, withstood the Great Depression and bought bonds during those financially troubled times to help finance the Golden Gate Bridge.And that movie camera in the mural? In the 1930s, Giannini and his bank also lent support to such films as “Gone With the Wind” as well as “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” by a young creator named Walt Disney.

The core idea is a tableau vivant— an arrangement of live models in poses (and costumes and backdrops) to mimic famous artworks, peppered with visual, narrative and musical surprises. All these years later, this summer event usually recreates about 40 great artworks (mostly paintings, but not all), organizing them by an annual theme and attaching a loose plot to keep the evening moving. Until you see one of these things, you may expect a static event with occasional muted tennis-tournament applause. Not so. Witty narration, music, acting, projected animation and old-fashioned schtick all play parts in creating a strangely potent, family-friendly night of entertainment in a 2,600-seat amphitheater. Dozens of professionals pitch in along with perhaps 500 volunteers. And because the area’s artists are still eager to sell, there’s also an juried art show with widely varied works from 140 artists (this year presented in a newly rebuilt complex of indoor-outdoor gallery structures). The 2017 pageant, which opened July 7 and closes  Aug. 31, was titled “The Grand Tour,” featuring scenes from throughout Europe, including posters from Buffalo Bill’s Wild West show on tour.

If you've heard the history of  Simon Rodia's Watts Towers in Los Angeles, this is largely the same thing, upside down.What: Forestiere came to the U.S. from Sicily in 1901 as a young man and bought land to start a citrus farm in West Fresno. But nobody warned him how hot it would be, or how hard the soil would be. So he adapted. He dug himself a cellar, savored the coolness, devised a system for turning hard-pan dirt into bricks, then set about building a mostly underground home with citrus trees whose top branches poked up through the skylights. For 40 years he dug and built, as deep as 33 feet beneath the surface. To make ends meet, he sold fruit and dug canals for other farmers. He never married but had plenty of friends, whom he entertained in his growing network of rooms and shady courtyards. (Plumbing? No.) After his death at 67 in 1946, a brother preserved part of the property and opened it for tours.About 60 years later, the gardens are owned by 89-year-old Rick Forestiere, a nephew of the old man, and the tours continue, from March through November. A guide shows you the ballroom, the kitchen, the bedrooms (one for summer, one for winter), the rooms Forestiere hoped to make into a resort, the glass-bottomed pond, the many surviving citrus trees he planted. (He loved grafting, and one used to yield seven different kinds of fruit. It still grows two different kinds of oranges.) ImageVisiting in August, I heard guide Karin Livingstone tell how Forestiere used a lot of rebar and, as a faithful Catholic, liked to do things in threes and sevens. Also, Livingstone said, \"he had a lot of wheelbarrows.\" Where: 5021 W. Shaw Ave., Fresno, 226 miles north of downtown L.A. About two-thirds of Forestiere's original acres lies beneath neighboring Highway 99.How much: For an hourlong tour, adults pay $17; children aged 5-17, $8.

Locals steal road signs so that outsiders can't find their way in. Now that attitude might be softening, and the town, surrounded by hiking, surfing and kayaking opportunities, is fascinating.What: About 50 years ago, hard-core Bolinas locals started stealing the town's highway sign and they never stopped. The goal, conceived in back-to-the-land idealism, was to build a nature-friendly community without the distractions and economic distortions of tourism. But as properties turn over and GPS renders signage moot, Bolinas seems to be evolving. Whether you're on the water or Wharf Road, it's a great place to think about hippie legacies and the nature of community at a time when Bay Area real estate is very nearly a blood sport.  Don't expect a tourist welcome center, but if you show up mellow and humble there's no reason you shouldn't drop in for a bite at the Coast Cafe; browse the tiny but well-appointed Bolinas Museum (open Fridays through Sundays only), or drink at Smiley's Schooner Saloon and Hotel, which goes back to the 19th century. In fact, Smiley's (which got new owners in 2015) offers live music four nights a week and rents out six rooms in back. I slept comfortably in one. On the street and in Smiley's, I was an obvious outsider with a camera around my neck, but everyone I met treated me well and Enzo Resta told me how his uncle may have been the first to take the town sign back in the day.You'll see plenty of gray pony tails (and experience rotten cellphone service). And keep an eye out for BO Gas, the only nonprofit service station I've ever encountered. The rates are shockingly high ($4.66 a gallon in early August) but the money helps support the Bolinas Community Land Trust. ImageWhere: Wharf Road, the commercial heart of town, is 25 miles northwest of San Francisco, just north of Stinson Beach, south of Point Reyes Station, 414 miles northwest of downtown L.A.How much: It's free to take a walk or check out the museum.

The excellent visitor center provides a fine and comfortable launch point, for guided or self-guided hikes amid these ancient totems.These are not the giant, majestic sequoias, but twisted and gnarled veterans. They are stunning. The trees look like living driftwood, and in some cases, as if they have been at war.  ImageIn a way they have. Oddly, the poorer the soil, the older the trees. That’s because the softer, healthier bristlecone pines here in the White Mountains fall victim to pests at higher rates than the slower growing trees nearby. Essentially, mankind and nature let them be.The oldest trees are found in an area called the Methuselah Walk, a four-mile loop that begins right outside the visitor center. It takes about two hours to hike. Take plenty of water and sunscreen.How to identify a bristlecone? Look for small branches resembling foxtails, and dark green needles in clusters of five.

Miners spent difficult days working the mines and nights working the bars, dance halls and gambling dens.  Gunfights and stage holdups were common as the riches were transported across long, dusty trails.

Whitney. The Sierra peak is the highest point in the contiguous U.S. at 14,505 feet (give or take). It’s a rocky stairway to high-altitude heaven that can only be conquered on foot.What: There are many routes up Whitney, but the most popular starts from the Whitney Portal just above the town of Lone Pine in the Eastern Sierra. Hikers usually set off during summer or sometimes fall. It's either a 22-mile round-trip day hike or a two- or three-day backpack journey, staying overnight at camps along the way. Wilderness permits are required for all trips and are awarded lottery-style every year. The well-trodden, 11-mile trail to the top entails about 6,000 feet of altitude gain. It’s an arduous slog with flowery and grassy meadows in the first few miles, mountain lakes and stream-side waterfalls as you climb higher and then 99 switchbacks, which bring you to Trail Crest at 13,600 feet. ImageThis is where you get a first glimpse of the craggy, rocky Sierra landscape above the treeline. Lakes below look like blue-green puddles; ridges and peaks seem endless. From here, it’s two more winding miles to the top along a hard-slab trail with steep drop-offs in places. At the top, hikers sign a register to document their victory, step into the stone shelter (built in 1909) and snap photos.The first modern hikers known to reach the top of Whitney were three local fishermen who summited in August 1873. Two months later, John Muir made an ascent. Hulda Crooks, known as Granny Whitney, scaled the summit about two dozen times between the ages of 65 and 91 before she died in 1997.Where: The hike starts at the Whitney Portal, accessible by road about 13 miles west of the town of Lone Pine, 220 miles north of downtown L.A. If you go, don’t forget to have a meal at the Whitney Portal Store — a burger if you make it down by evening, or breakfast pancakes in the morning, if you don’t. It’s a kind of base camp where hikers can celebrate their victory and buy a T-shirt to commemorate the day.How much: Permits to hike up the trail are $20 each.

Steven Spielberg chose it as a location for “The Lost World: Jurassic Park” because the whole place looks prehistoric. And it is.What: Fern Canyon is exactly as its name describes. Feathery ferns sprout from nearly every square inch of the 30-plus-foot cliffs lining this narrow ravine. The effect is like fluffy, 3-D wallpaper. If it doesn't bring Spielberg to mind, it might bring Jim Henson. Some fern species found here can be traced back 325 million years, with gallant names like the dark green sword and the delicate lady. As you hike deeper into the shadowy canyon, the ferns take over your field of view — it’s green tunnel vision. Scan the environs for mini-waterfalls trickling through moss as well as shy amphibians, and be sure to take a good, deep sniff. It smells like the Industrial Revolution never happened.The Fern Canyon Loop is a flat path of 0.7 miles, easy enough for young children or road-trippers stiff from the bumpy drive in. (It’s about 9 miles from the highway on a dirt road that plows straight through a few small, stony streams.) In summer, rangers place foot bridges (read: slippery wooden planks) on the trail. Wear hiking boots if you have them, rain boots if you don’t, or sneakers if you don’t mind spending the day with wet socks. For avid hikers eager to tack on a few extra miles, the James Irvine Trail, which begins at the visitors center, is an alternate route to the canyon. If you brought lunch, stop at the Elk Meadow picnic area, where you’re almost guaranteed to see a grazing elk or two.

It’s where Edward Hubble and others confirmed that the universe is expanding, key evidence in support of the Big Bang theory.The sprawling complex is located in what was once cowboy country. Thieves once stashed stolen horses in the surrounding caves and canyons. In the mid-1800s, Benjamin Wilson, a rancher from the flatlands, went searching for timber for his wine casks, following old Indian trails to the site of Mt. Wilson.By the late 1800s, those trails were used to set up the observatory. In 1917, astronomers began using the world's largest telescope there. There was even a hotel at one time, the $3-a-night Mt. Wilson Hotel, which closed in the late '60s.Today, the cluster of vintage telescopes has gone into semi-retirement, used by school and astronomy clubs at group prices that start at $1,000.

Without the discovery of gold in Coloma in January 1848, our state wouldn’t be what it is. And nearby Placerville will give you a taste of how fast things changed. What: Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park is a big, rambling place, with a hilltop memorial, a bunch of replica buildings, a museum, frequent gold-panning, blacksmithing and other activities, and paths along a stretch of the American River (South Fork) where Sutter’s Mill stood before it burned in the 1860s. (You may be shocked to learn how rich Mr. Sutter didn't get, by the way.)But temper your expectations.Damage from high waters earlier this year has closed off some of the riverside. And growth of the oak trees has covered most of the views from the hilltop. If you've already had a great state-park experience in Sutter's Fort in Sacramento or the reconstructed town of Columbia State Historic Park, (82 miles to the south), this spot might not quicken your pulse in the same way.

First you confront the falls from above, looking down slightly across a gorge. Then you descend by trail, facing the water as you go. Once you're halfway down, the water seems wider. When you reach the foot, the roar seems far more powerful -- and mist covers everything. You can scramble across rocks to reach the edge of the pool, if you dare. (The winter's storms did force temporary closure of one popular trail; check the park website for trail closure before arrival.)   ImageBy the way, you might spot an angler or two near the top of the falls. But be warned: State restrictions ban visitors from approaching within 20 yards above the top of the falls, with greater distances required at the bottom. If you stick to the trails, you'll be fine.The 910-acre park also has a campground, cabins, a marina on Lake Britton and a general store.Where: Highway 89, 6 miles north of Highway 299, 64 miles northeast of Redding, 612 miles north of downtown L.A.How much: Admission to state park is $8 per car.Info: McArthur-Burney Falls State Park","dateModified":"2018-01-25T00:56:13.627Z","datePublished":"2017-07-20T13:00:00.000Z","headline":"Drink in the mist from Northern California’s Burney Falls, 129 feet tall and handsome as they come","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/74f78b4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/800x450+0+40/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3c%2F32%2F20fdd002327534aa10db88f8d058%2F800","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-california-bucket-list-updates-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Christopher Reynolds"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-california-bucket-list-updates-2017-htmlstory.html#drink-in-the-mist-from-northern-californias-burney-falls-129-feet-tall-and-handsome-as-they-come"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageWhy: It’s the biggest sundial in California, and you can sort of see through it.What: Designed by Santiago Calatrava of Spain, this bridge has been a celebrity since the day in opened (July 4, 2004), surrounded by a 300-acre parking along the Sacramento River. The bridge's 217-foot-tall, slanted white pylon (the technical term, I just learned, is gnomon) draws you in, and the glass-and-steel deck makes it semi-translucent. On the morning I crossed the bridge, the place was busy with moms and strollers and dogs and kids and dads and anglers.Don't count on the bridge as a timekeeping device, though. Local leaders say it doesn't work in winter; in other months, it's basically impossible to read except between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. But it's so attractive that people can't stay away, nor can swallows.

Stepping off a bluff under a hang glider is almost pneumatic, as if compressors are involved.What: All you really want to know is how difficult it is, and I'd compare hang-gliding to opening an umbrella or smearing a bagel with cream cheese. Essentially, anybody who is fairly active can hang-glide. You're harnessed into this 40-foot training glider, which wants to fly the way beer barrels want to float. QuoteBeginner sessions are offered Wednesdays through Sundays, on bluffs 15 to 30 feet high. There is the training, then four to seven flights, of various lengths, and soft landings. It’s not exactly idiot-proof, but the risks are minimal, and the instructors patient and encouraging.You start at the lower “bunny bluffs,” then work up to longer flights.

The Russians arrived in 1809 and bailed out in 1841, seven years before the U.S. grabbed California from Mexico.

There is enough showbiz lore here – trysts, honeymoons and naked sunbathing – to be a movie in itself,  a “Caddyshack” for the rich and resplendent. Still, the old hotel retains a dignity and opulence. For most of us, the best way to sample that is a leisurely lunch at the Polo Lounge.What: Sure, it’s open almost all the time (7 a.m. to 1:30 a.m.) but the time to go is at lunch. Make your reservation for 1, on the patio (not inside) and draw the afternoon out on the sun-dappled brick, where bougainvillea petals will butterfly down into your salad or soup, as if a special effect. The Polo Lounge is not cheap, and it’s probably not the best meal in town, but it might be the grandest and most memorable. A grand piano plays at just the proper volume, and the service is attentive, not fussy.Closer to the coast, you’d be cold; closer to downtown, a little too warm. Here, the air is so sublime it’s almost carbonated. There are Polo Lounge offshoots too: a Sunday jazz brunch and afternoon teas, from 3-5 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. But before you try anything else here, go for lunch, which is casual and relaxed. A decent pair of jeans is fine.Unless you’re famished, stick with the salads, which is what Beverly Hills does best anyway. You can always add tuna, shrimp or steak. A perennial favorite is the McCarthy – chicken, beets, eggs, bacon, avocado – a salad almost as famous as some of the patrons who order it. But you’re not there for the food, particularly Russian caviar that goes for $190 an ounce. You’re there for the special effects.  How much?

Tender in the middle, crunchy on the edges, the double-baked bread is the stage of this luscious sandwich. Then again, it might be the meat. Epic poems have been written over far less.What: Langer’s Delicatessen opened in 1947, with about a dozen seats. Still in a struggling, working-class neighborhood across from MacArthur Park, it now draws huge crowds for breakfast and lunch.The menu is a ferocious mix of deli standards: egg salad, matzo ball soup, cheese blintzes. Carved from the navel of a steer, and cured as you would corn beef, pastrami is by far the most-popular meat. The flavor comes from a combo of smoking and steaming that preserves the moisture.There are 20 ways to get it, but the best is the No. 19 combo, featuring hot pastrami, cole slaw, Russian dressing and a slice of Swiss on that amazing rye bread.The secret?

A wall of trees to your left. A wall of trees to your right. Dozens of species of chattering birds. Minnows doing button-hooks beneath a ribbon of urban drool.

These fascinating creatures have attracted and entranced Californians since long before Europeans reached these shores. For a two-hour period late on the nights after the highest tides, grunions ride in on waves and flop onto the sand en masse to deposit their eggs. If you're fishing or catching and releasing, that's your cue to reach in and grab the grunion with bare hands. But it may be thrill enough just to watch the tide of fish under the night sky.  ImageThe Cabrillo Marine Aquarium at Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro offers an introduction to the spectacle. The museum opens its door at 8 p.m. for two scheduled nights in June and two more in July to offer a “Meet the Grunion” program that includes guided observation of grunions on the beach.Often, this adventure means waiting for a while on a beach at night. Bring warm clothes and a flashlight. Fishing for grunions is allowed, except in April and May.

Nowadays it gets a lot of business travelers, who stride purposefully through rooms done up in a glitzy mix of Renaissance, baroque, neo-classical and Moorish styles.The tale is told that this is where aspiring actress Elizabeth Short -- a.k.a. the Black Dahlia -- was last seen alive before her notorious unsolved murder in 1947.  And the hotel's Gallery Bar serves a Black Dahlia in her memory -- citrus vodka, Chambord and Kahlua. Inconveniently, some who have studied the case closely say there's no solid connection between Short and the bar. But the hotel has seen plenty of shooting, including many movies (\"Chinatown\"), perhaps the longest talking-while-walking shot ever on TV's \"The West Wing,\" and the semi-dirty dancing in singer Ed Sheeran's \"Thinking Out Loud\" video.Odds are you will find Greg Guzelian at the bar.

It is anchored by the Natural History Museum, home to sprawling dinosaur displays, and by the California Science Center, where the star attraction these days is the shuttle Endeavour. This ultra-popular exhibit honors the space shuttle program and its connection to California, where orbiters originated.

The park's hike-in environmental sites have pit toilets and picnic tables but no water. Spooner's Cove is the most popular beach, right across from the campground. Dogs are permitted in campsites and on park roads and must be on a leash no longer than six feet.  Except for Spooner’s Cove, dogs are not allowed on the trails or beaches.Be sure to bring your own firewood or buy at the camp host site (campsite 22). Campsites 18, 19, 20 are closest to the beach; 40, 41 and 42 offer a little more privacy. Interested in having an RV delivered to your site?

The Central Library, born in 1926, is such an oasis. It’s the sort of marbled cultural sanctuary where Aristotle might’ve wandered at will. You should too.  What: The original Central Library is an early example of Art Deco, a popular style of architecture from the mid-1920s through the 1930s. It was designed by Bertram Goodhue, in the last project of a career that included the Nebraska Capitol. He died unexpectedly in 1924, and Carleton Winslow took over and completed the project in 1926. After a long renovation, the Central Library was reopened in 1993, with the landmark Goodhue Building restored and a new wing named for former Mayor Tom Bradley. During the renovation, most of the library’s collection was moved to the new Tom Bradley Wing, and the original library building is now given over primarily to exhibitions, reader services and administration.Adding life and beauty to the facility is a series of sculptures, paintings, historical murals and a magnificent rotunda featuring the Zodiac Chandelier. The adjacent Maguire Gardens are one of downtown’s top outdoor spaces -- shady and thick with fountains.It’s a lot to take in, so consider one of the free walk-in docent tours that take place daily, and twice on Saturdays.

Amazing beaches ring the lake, but at some point head south to Emerald Bay, to my mind the most dazzling freshwater cove in California.What: Lake Tahoe is a large Sierra lake resting between California and Nevada. The north shore is anchored by Tahoe City, a bustling resort town with an array of restaurants, inns and a launch point for Truckee River float trips. It also features marinas with boat rentals, some pretty pricey. But boat rental shops dot the lake. A wonderful pit stop for food and drink is the deck at Sunnyside Resort, on the west side of the lake.On the southwest shore, Emerald Bay State Park contains the 1929 Nordic-style mansion Vikingsholm, and the \"Tea House\" on Fannette Island, the only island to be found in all of Lake Tahoe.Glassy at sunup and sunset, the lake can kick up in the afternoon.

It also has come to complement a series of nearby attractions, such as Madame Tussauds wax museum, the Hollywood & Highland mall and a series of tourist-themed shops and kiosks. Jimmy Kimmel tapes his show across the street, near the gloriously restored El Capitan Theatre. If your timing is right, you can catch the unveiling of a new sidewalk star.  About two stars are added each month, and the Walk of Fame keeps a schedule on its website.

Transplanted from its original venue 80 years ago, the neighborhood northeast of downtown retains an authentic vibe, in a region otherwise threatened with mass gentrification. It is famously notorious in the classic Jack Nicholson movie \"Chinatown,\" but today it is a relatively safe, wonderfully scented and an easy-to-navigate stretch of shops and vast dim sum houses.What: Chinatown was bumped to its current location in the 1930s, to allow for the building of the opulent Union Station. Today, it features restaurants, groceries, herbal shops and galleries. Amid its various attractions are a jazz club; a Cajun deli; a growing number of art galleries; many Vietnamese restaurants; and L.A.’s favorite French dip sandwich shop, Philippe the Original.It also features an even better lunch spot, Howlin’ Ray’s, a Nashville-style fried chicken joint that serves, to my mind, the best (and spiciest) sandwich in Los Angeles. Needless to say, it is hardly one thing.But it remains to this day a hub of Chinese culture and tradition, and the site of Chinese New Year’s celebrations and Moon festivals.

The water is chilly, the air dry and warm, and the scenery spectacular.Beneath the water — or peeking out — are granite boulders not to be taken lightly. If you fall in, as the guides will warn repeatedly, point your feet down river to protect yourself from rocks. Your first dunk is scary. After that, it’s still scary but you learn the drill.The season runs April to September, possibly even later this year, given the abundant Sierra snows.The Kern features 60 miles of commercially run whitewater rafting, and companies offer trips ranging from safe and easy family floats to daring Class V adventures suitable only for fit adults.Day trips with big rapids can be found on both the upper and lower Kern.

And wait until you see the poster collection upstairs.What: Born as a dance hall, this auditorium dates to 1912. Since then it's been many things, including a roller rink. From the outside it looks like a fortress. But in the late 1960s, under the leadership of impresario Bill Graham, it made its name as a rock concert venue. There have been a few detours since then, but that tradition continues now.   ImageThe hall, illuminated by 10 dramatic chandeliers, holds about 1,100 people, most of whom stand on the chairless dance floor. Others sit in the upstairs mezzanine area (better views, easier bar access). The poster collection filling the walls upstairs is a festival of boomer flashbacks: the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Santana, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Big Brother and the Holding Company. Tom Petty. Los Lobos. And it's not all graybeards. Younger bands such as the Wood Brothers (who played in March) come, too.On your way out, Fillmore staffers are likely to hand you an apple and perhaps a poster, too. (Both traditions date to the hall's earliest gigs under Bill Graham, who died in 1991.)(And if you're sampling classic rock venues in the city, you might also want to try the Great American Music Hall, built in 1907 on O'Farrell Street, a mile to the east.)Where: 1805 Geary Blvd., San Francisco, 383 miles northwest of downtown L.A.How much: Prices vary widely and sales happen through Live Nation (the entertainment behemoth that owns the venue and Ticketmaster).

It is 10 minutes from downtown Los Angeles, in a safe working-class neighborhood that is slowly gentrifying. As with LAX, leave yourself plenty of time for traffic and parking. A free shuttle from Union Station is also a popular option.Thing is, don’t push it, because Dodgers games are as casual as casual comes. If they took all the comfort food away from baseball games, no one would go, so be sure to come hungry. A Dodger Dog is perhaps L.A.’s most famous dish -- get two, because they’re skinny as starlets.Sellout games are rare, and decent walk-up tickets are almost always available. For day games, pick a seat on the third base side to avoid the punishing summer sun. The best level is the loge, which is higher than the field level but gives better sight lines, usually at cheaper prices. For the most rollicking times, sit in the pavilions (the outfield), or the top deck, where the game is less important than the beach balls and the beer. As with any urban ballpark, the behavior can get a little crude. If it gets too much, ask an usher to reseat you, or just find some alternative seats on your own.

The museum has tripled its exhibition space, which is mostly dedicated to the years since 1945. It has boosted its emphasis on photography (from its 19th century invention to the present), added an outdoor \"living wall\" of greenery and a terrace, and bedecked its restrooms in colors so bold that you probably ought to nip into one, whether you need to or not. ImageMeanwhile, the catwalk, part of the building's original 1995 design, remains a thrill.

One of SoCal’s great day trips, it offers a fetching sea village, with plenty of splashy ways to have fun, or opportunities to just kick back and soak in the Mediterranean vibe.What: Twenty-two miles off the coast, Catalina is a small island that has been drawing families and weekend party crowds for generations. It offers boat rides, submarine tours, snorkeling, miniature golf, cycling and a beach club that feels too exclusive to be open to the public. Sounds touristy, right? Well, a little. But Catalina retains a rustic, under-developed charm. ImageMost visitors land in Avalon, a town of 4,000, where shops and restaurants face the harbor. Rental golf carts and bikes are the preferred modes of transportation. A short stroll toward the landmark round casino reveals Descanso Beach Club, where you can throw a towel on the lawn or rent a lounge chair for the day.

First the city's biggest department stores gathered there, then a dozen movie houses and vaudeville theaters (most of which remain). As the city spread out, Broadway started speaking with a Mexican accent. Now, as millennials converge at the city center, it's gentrifying but still gritty.

That means, most of the time, it's easy to get a photo of the houses with the city skyline lined up behind them.

In fact, it's the oldest surviving structure in San Francisco. What: Formally, this is the Mission San Francisco de Asís, but everyone says Dolores. Right behind the building lies the cemetery, where an estimated 5,000 Ohlone, Miwok and other native people are buried along with several Irish immigrants and other 19th century California pioneers.

The building is surrounded by the 40-acre Capitol Park, which is full of shade trees (much prized in summer in Sacramento).  Public and student tours of the building and Capitol Park are free and frequent. There's also a California State Capitol Museum.Where: Capitol building, 1315 10th St., Sacramento city and county, 385 miles northwest of downtown L.A.How much: FreeInfo: California State Capitol Museum  ","dateModified":"2018-01-25T01:01:38.228Z","datePublished":"2017-04-16T14:00:00.000Z","headline":"Spot grizzlies under the Capitol dome in Sacramento","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/60ccc20/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1524x857+0+595/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F09%2F31ea6dad3cd2cadfb096fd7bf8a9%2Fla-trb-rotunda-state-capitol-sacramento-20161212","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-california-bucket-list-updates-2017-htmlstory.html"},"author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Christopher Reynolds"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Los Angeles Times","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e7e58f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","width":382,"height":60}},"url":"https://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-california-bucket-list-updates-2017-htmlstory.html#spot-grizzlies-under-the-capitol-dome-in-sacramento"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","articleBody":"ImageWhy: If the legendary Musso & Frank Grill ever closes, I’m leaving L.A.

Since 1934, it has drawn locals, TV stars, moms with strollers and visitors from around the world. (We've lost Carrie Fisher since the striking portrait above was shot there in the late 1980s, but the market looks just the same.) Part of the magic is the confluence of so many cuisines – Cajun, barbecue, Brazilian, French, Japanese – in one location. My two favorites: Bob’s Coffee & Doughnuts, on the east patio, where cranks, know-it-alls, philosophers and other folks with too much time on their hands gather to gab and grab coffee. At the other end of the market is Charlie’s Coffee Shop, noted for old-school French toast ($6.25) and amazing cheeseburgers ($6.95). Ask for Charlie Sue herself, who has run the place since 1976.Part of the appeal is that the market isn’t just for visitors. It’s a practical pit stop for locals looking for a slab of sirloin at one of the impressive butcher counters, or a place to get a house key cut. This functionality, plus the sense of fun, make the old place one of the most authentic and enjoyable retreats in the city.Where: 6333 W.

And it was time enough for somebody to design a flag featuring a grizzly bear that, unfortunately, looked a lot like a pig. By 1848, the U.S. had taken control of Alta California, including Sonoma, by prevailing in the Mexican War.Now Sonoma County is at the heart of Northern California wine country, with more than 425 wineries.

ImageLinden Avenue is lined with an unfussy collection of surf shops, antique stores and restaurants, including The Spot, a rustic burger stand; and The Palms, which has been inviting customers to grill their own steaks since the 1960s. The avenue ends at the beach, where Carpinteria State Beach and its campground begin. Lifeguards patrol the state beach year-round, with an added squad of city lifeguards in summer.Three miles southeast of town lies Rincon Beach Park, one of the state's top surf spots. Just inland, the foothills are full of orchards and nurseries, which explains why the California Avocado Festival is held here every fall. The 2017 fest (live music, vast vats of guacamole, etc.) is scheduled for Oct. 6-8.By the way: If you take a long walk on the beach, you might find tar between your toes.

Now about two dozen of the cottages are in high demand as rentals. (If you've seen the 1988 Bette Midler movie \"Beaches,\" you've seen these cottages.)Here's the history many people miss: In 1927, when landowner Irvine Co. started leasing out hundreds of acres here, a Japanese American farming community sprang up. Those early tenants worked crops, opened roadside produce stands, built houses, barns and a community center -- and then they were forced into an internment camp in Arizona after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941.By the time the war was over and they were free, new tenants had taken over, and the Japanese American families had to start over elsewhere.Arriving these days, you park up the hill and take a shuttle down from the state park's parking lot.

And hotel. ImageNow the Harris people have a cattle-based citadel on the roadside. The dining operations -- three restaurants, basically -- together seat up to 455 people at a time.

About 20,000 to 25,000 Pacific gray whales migrate every year. To the grays, the warm waters off Mexico are a giant nursery; they give birth there before returning north to Alaska to feed.What: The winter gray-whale season starts just after Christmas, peaks in mid-January and runs through April. Sightseeing trips generally last three hours, and depart in mornings or afternoons. First-timers should dress in layers to ward off the chill, wear skid-resistant shoes and bring sunscreen, even on overcast winter days. Morning departures are generally gentler than in the afternoons, when the winds pick up.Where: Piers and harbors across Southern California, including:Harbor Breeze Cruises runs tours out of Long Beach, near the Aquarium of the Pacific, usually at noon and 3 p.m. Adults, $45; children 3-11 $40; under 3 free.

Lee (elevation 1,708 feet), but many of them make enemies in Beachwood Canyon, the neighborhood under the sign. Not you.You might even make friends because you won’t stop in the middle of North Beachwood Drive to take photos. And you’ll park legally (which means doing this on a weekday or adding a quarter-mile to your hike) or you'll take a ride-share or a taxi to the starting point.But which starting point? If you want to wind up above the sign's 45-foot-tall letters, looking down through a chain-link fence, one route, often known as the Hollyridge Trail, begins at the end of North Beachwood Drive, by Sunset Ranch. It was about 3 1/2 miles, with an elevation gain of about 900 feet -- but in early 2017, city officials under legal pressure said they would try to reroute hikers away from Sunset Ranch.Info: Hikespeak.comAnother route to the same endpoint is steeper, narrower and shorter: the Wonder View Trail and Aileen Getty Ridge Trail (a round trip of three miles, elevation gain of 875 feet), which begins near Lake Hollywood Drive.And of course there are plenty of other hikes in Griffith Park yielding Hollywood sign views from all sorts of angles. It's free, no permit is required dogs are allowed, but the park is closed to hikers before sunrise and after sunset.By the way, don’t underestimate the equestrian alternative: Instead of hiking, ride a horse from Sunset Ranch at the end of Beachwood Drive (after the road narrows and the pavement stops). There are plenty of sign views here, too. For $95, you can catch sunset and finish up with catered barbecue back at the ranch.Where: The Hollywood sign, above Sunset Ranch, 3400 N.

Then (following the directions the rental people give you) ride across the Golden Gate Bridge. It's 1.7 miles across the bridge, and there's no toll for cyclists or pedestrians.Pause part way to look up at the 746-foot-tall towers and consider that military leaders once liked the idea of painting the bridge black and yellow. Once across, catch your breath (and maybe order a cool beverage) at the snazzy Cavallo Point Lodge (a former military base that's now a hotel with bar and restaurant) or next door at the grittier Travis Marina Bar of the Presidio Yacht Club.

And all the world’s creatures seem to be here.What: For all its global fame, the San Diego Zoo boils down to about 3,700 animals on 100 acres, not unlike some colleges. And like some students, these creatures spend a lot of time asleep. Sadly, you can't order pizza for them. But you can plot your visit to see them eating, when they're livelier. You might even get to feed a critter yourself. On weekends, there’s an 11 a.m. sign-up in the Urban Jungle to feed giraffes (three biscuits for $15); and there’s a wolf-keeper presentation at 11:30 a.m. daily. Check the zoo’s online list of keeper talks and animal encounters list to see what’s up when. Or splurge on an added program. For $109 on top of the usual admission price, you can get in two hours early to see the pandas, which just might be chewing on bamboo. And the Animals in Action program (ages 5 and older) is pricey at an added $109 for an hour, but it usually gives visitors a chance to feed flamingos from a cup.If you're there with kids, give it a whole day. And if you still want more critters, set aside a second day for the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, where about 3,500 animals roam much more widely on 1,800 acres near Escondido, 32 miles north of the zoo.
